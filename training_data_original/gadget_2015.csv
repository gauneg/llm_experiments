"affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .","[('price', 'pos'), ('item', 'pos'), ('customer service', 'pos')]"
i did have problem connecting my laptop to the internet but there customer service representative was very helpful and patient in walking me through all the steps .,"[('customer service', 'pos')]"
i have no regrets and thankful to find this product in amazon .,[]
after much homework and too much frustration with our cable provided wireless routers -lrb- 4 replacements in 8 months -rrb- we decided on the netgear n900 !,[]
i am above average with technical knowledge but it is easy enough for the beginner to set up .,"[('set up', 'pos')]"
i had no problems .,[]
our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .,"[('speed', 'pos'), ('connection', 'pos')]"
the only problem i encountered why i gave it only 4 stars is when i plugged in a usb storage device .,[]
the device is not recognizable on any of the computers even after installing the netgear genie .,[]
the only way i 'm able to access this usb drive is by going through the netgear genie through the isp of the storage device .,[]
"i was happy when i saw all my files and i was able to access them but when i tried to attach a document or file to an email , again i found you ca n't do this !",[]
so the solution i had to do was to make a copy of the image and documents onto my local computer in order to then upload .,[]
if they fix this issue -lrb- which i 've seen in their support as the major complaint -rrb- i would give this a 5-star rating .,[]
"please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop , upload , attach , etc. .","[('firmware upgrade', 'pos')]"
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better .,"[('netgear genie tool', 'neg')]"
the packaging and instructions give the indication of plug-n-play usb ports where you can use any storage device and have it immediately appear in your network as if it was attached to your local computers ... this is a fallacy as it does not actually work that way .,[]
"after my dlink di-614 + router died after 5 years , i bought my new router for a couple bucks less at costco .",[]
costco package offered a 24\/7 customer support number .,[]
since my router and internet connection were down i could n't use installation wizard .,[]
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup .,"[('customer service', 'pos')]"
"have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what i had with old router .","[('signal strength', 'pos'), ('speed', 'pos')]"
so far so good .,[]
if i get a chance to setup and confirm advanced features i 'll come back to update review\/rating .,[]
"it works , good customer service -lrb- so far -rrb- = 4 stars .","[('customer service', 'pos')]"
i just got this netgear to replace an pre-n belkin .,[]
i must be getting interference from other people in the building so my connection sometimes would hang .,[]
"video would pixle , so did n't watch that often .",[]
i had the usb adapter for one computer and the express card for the laptop .,[]
the laptop had the better reception .,[]
"sometimes the system would hang , so i would have to restart the router , then get going again .","[('router', 'neg'), ('hang', 'neg')]"
"started looking for a new router , saw this one and thought i 'd give it a try from the reviews .",[]
i 'm glad i did .,[]
"i did n't have to call customer care , i followed the wizard , and it was fairly easy .",[]
"naming the bandwidth was a new one for me , i named it the same as my password .",[]
"oops , easy to go online , and adjust it there .","[('go online', 'pos'), ('adjust', 'pos')]"
plan to read through the manual to understand more of what it can do .,[]
from the belkin my reception increased over 25 % .,"[('reception', 'pos')]"
"it is tall , so i ended up laying it on its side .","[('tall', 'neg')]"
connection to the device is so easy .,"[('connection', 'pos')]"
"i just went to my laptop , it saw the router , i clicked on the name , then you go over to the router and push the button near the bottom , your connected .",[]
very pleased at this time .,[]
the d-link dir-655 extreme n wireless router works fine as a 802.11 n wireless router .,"[('d-link dir-655 extreme n wireless router', 'pos')]"
"however , the reason i bought it was to wirelessly share my printer between two macs using the usb shareport on the router .",[]
shareport is not compatible with mac os .,"[('shareport', 'neg')]"
"after hours of searching the internet , i was disappointed to find that d-link does not provide support for mac os 10 .",[]
i bought this in combination with a d-link dwa-140 wireless usb adapter .,[]
"d-link does not provide mac support for the adapter , however i was able to find a free third-party driver that is compatible .","[('mac support', 'neg')]"
the best solution for sharing a printer is to use an apple airport express or apple airport extreme .,[]
i returned both d-link products and purchased an airport express .,[]
"it was running in a couple minutes , and very easy to wirelessly share my printer .",[]
i was told by the qwest support to upgrade my cisco 678 to a pk5000 .,[]
"the router does n't support port translation , e.g forward port 8080 in the outside to port 80 in the inside .","[('port translation', 'neg')]"
"nor there is a clear manual offered by the manufacturer or by qwest , qwest does provide some info , but nothing about what is not intuitive enough in the screen .","[('manual', 'neg')]"
"called actiontec for a fix , but they do n't support it , their recommendation was to use it as a bridge , and use a real router behind .",[]
"-lrb- yeah , like you 'll use a new , very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge -rrb- i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead .","[('dsl modem', 'neg')]"
"i am a long time d-link customer -lrb- owned 3 different d-link routers -rrb- , the last two all failed in one year .",[]
"when i bought the third one , i thought i can give d-link one more try , but now i regret my decision .","[('d-link', 'neg')]"
"the router failed today -lrb- completely dead -rrb- , when i need to work from home due to heavy snow !","[('router', 'neg')]"
"should have bought the linksys routers , no more d-link for me .",[]
this is a great buy as far as i know .,[]
with the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch,"[('cost', 'pos'), ('wireless punch', 'pos')]"
i upgraded from the netgear wpn824 and wow what a difference !,[]
"with the wndr37av i now get full bars in every room , through four walls -lrb- metal stud construction -rrb- except in the garage which gets almost full bars .",[]
setup was very easy .,"[('setup', 'pos')]"
"this router does drop every once in a while , but not like the old router did every hour or so !","[('router', 'neg')]"
the usb port on the back is a nice feature .,"[('usb port', 'pos'), ('feature', 'pos')]"
i wish they would have taken it a step further and added one or two more for additional storage or a local printer server .,[]
"the data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but i only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much .","[('data rate', 'neg')]"
in all i 'd say this is a decent router for the money .,"[('router', 'pos')]"
"my house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .","[('product', 'pos'), ('signal interruptions', 'pos')]"
"the model is also very clean and nice , and the software is very user-friendly .","[('model', 'pos'), ('software', 'pos')]"
"these were only my first week impressions but , until now , i strongly recommend this product and i 'm very satisfied with it .","[('product', 'pos')]"
bought a d link .,[]
cd does not provide guidance for support for mac or software to install for mac .,[]
technical support rude and unhelpful .,"[('technical support', 'neg')]"
this router replaced an aging linksys wrt54g .,[]
"the d-link has a ton of features including usb printer sharing , two wireless networks -lrb- one not connected to the lan -rrb- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .","[('printer sharing', 'pos'), ('menu', 'pos')]"
i have owned this for over 6 months and have never had to reset it due to instability .,[]
"i would buy this again , and recommend it to others .",[]
my old wireless g was having issues and dropping out .,[]
all of the resets and chasing upgrades were n't helping .,[]
"i took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what i paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .","[('product', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
piece of cake to set up .,"[('set up', 'pos')]"
i had all four of our computers up and running on the network in about an hour .,[]
"no dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -lrb- unit is located on the top floor -rrb- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .","[('signal strength', 'pos'), ('setup', 'pos'), ('security', 'pos')]"
"i would n't mind having an external adjustable antenna , but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved .","[('speed', 'pos')]"
i was really looking for a way to have a wireless nas .,[]
i contacted netgear before buying to ask if i could set it up as a repeater -lrb- to my primary netgear router -rrb- with the usb drive enabled .,[]
the answer was yes .,[]
the set-up went fairly smooth with netgears online knowledge base .,"[('set-up', 'pos')]"
i hooked up a lacie external drive and everything seemed to work fine .,[]
it showed up on the network .,[]
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow .,"[('slow', 'neg')]"
"so slow , that it is not useable for files of any size or back-ups .","[('slow', 'neg'), ('useable', 'neg')]"
"i read online and found that my expectations should not be high , but this thing was roughly equivalent to using a dial-up internet connection .",[]
i verified the signal strengths with a laptop and there was no problem there .,"[('signal strengths', 'pos')]"
e-mailed netgear and they insisted that i call .,[]
"after about 30 minutes into it , they told me that they could not help me any further -lrb- without a fee -rrb- because my primary netgear router is out of warranty .",[]
my primary router has no problems at all .,[]
the old router has worked well for going on two years .,[]
netgear refused to diagnose the wnr3500l without a fee because i was repeating an older netgear router .,[]
i told them i would send it back and they said ok .,[]
i just sent it back for refund today .,[]
bottom line - do n't buy this for the usb function .,"[('usb function', 'neg')]"
i bought this router to replace an old linksys and to go hand-in-hand with a new motorola sb6120 modem .,[]
having received the router first i elected to hold off setting it up until i got the new modem .,[]
after receiving the sb6120 and setting it up i set up the router following the instructions they gave .,[]
"the set up was pretty simple , basically a matter of hooking everything up and rebooting your system at which time you 're taken to the d-link website to finalize how your setup will be .","[('set up', 'pos')]"
this part confused me as i could n't find how to set your security parameters .,[]
"however , a phone call to the d-link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem .","[('d-link support crew', 'pos')]"
as of this review i am using the router and it is working very nicely .,"[('router', 'pos'), ('working', 'pos')]"
"moreover , i found it to be more user friendly than the old linksys i had .",[]
as a final comment i am happy with the d-link dir-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether i 'm using my asus netbook or apple ipad .,"[('d-link dir-655', 'pos'), ('connections', 'pos')]"
finally got around to installing my cisco-valet .,[]
installation was easy as advertised .,"[('installation', 'pos')]"
had couple of minor questions ... tech support number provided said it was available 24\/1 .,[]
"since it was sunday , was very skeptical .",[]
"made call which was immediately answered by very helpful , competent tech .","[('tech', 'pos')]"
best tech support i have ever experienced .,"[('tech support', 'pos')]"
amazing speed and easy to set up .,"[('speed', 'pos'), ('set up', 'pos')]"
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position .,"[('range', 'pos')]"
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house -lrb- about 3500 sq ft -rrb- and it 's located in the corner of my basement .,"[('coverage', 'pos')]"
i 'll report back after i have it up and running for a while .,[]
ok ... .,[]
let me start by saying that home networking is bane of my existence .,[]
i must live in some sort of black hole as i have been through several different routers in attempts to have my wireless network up to the standard i believe it should be .,[]
the set up for this product was a breeze .,"[('set up', 'pos')]"
real piece of cake .,[]
"surprisingly , everything seems to work well .","[('work', 'pos')]"
"my 2 xboxs , ipod , iphone , ipad are all catching a nice strong signal .","[('signal', 'pos')]"
no drops ... the only problem i have had so far is my apple tv which was operating on the 5.0 ghz signal .,[]
it did drop -lrb- just once -rrb- .,[]
now i have only been using this for a few days so this is a very early review .,[]
my b + could grow to an a if things stay on course .,[]
i 'm hopeful !!!,[]
addition on 4\/14\/2011 \*\*\* i 've just had the 2nd router of this model go bad inside of 5 months .,"[('router', 'neg')]"
"after the problem i recounted below concerning the first unit , i got a replacement and put the replacement in service .",[]
last night i needed to reset the router .,"[('reset', 'neg')]"
"i unplugged it , plugged it back in , and the power supply failed .","[('power supply', 'neg')]"
i used a previous router for more than six years without a single problem .,[]
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned .,"[('model router', 'neg')]"
there are too many competitors in the price range to take a chance on this shoddy model .,[]
no wonder they had to offer a ` life-time ' warranty on it .,[]
they 'll be sending plenty of them out .,[]
"however , you may not want to be without a router for the time it takes them to replace this -lrb- if you buy it -rrb- when it fails .",[]
avoid this model like the plague .,"[('model', 'neg')]"
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* i 'd had a previous wireless router for years that worked fine .,[]
"however , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection .","[('bandwidth hogging software', 'neg'), ('internet connection', 'neg')]"
"pros : so off i went to get a faster router , and this one did the job i bought it for admirably .","[('router', 'pos')]"
"set up was smooth , and both wired and wireless devices worked very well on it .","[('set up', 'pos')]"
"the bandwidth hogs were no longer locking up my network , and rainbows filled the sky .",[]
"huge con : while i was in the setup screen one day to double check my wireless network password , i noticed that a link had appeared announcing the presence of a firmware upgrade .",[]
normally i have found this to be a good thing .,[]
"my blu-ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back , smile , and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade , and perform well forever thereafter .","[('perform', 'pos')]"
"well , not this box .",[]
"halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar , the infamous browser `` page not found '' screen replaced most of the router 's interface .","[('firmware upgrade', 'neg')]"
"the network was down , the internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .","[('network', 'neg'), ('internet connection', 'neg'), ('router', 'neg')]"
"after that , the router would never even respond to its own internal browser link .","[('router', 'neg')]"
no amount of tech support or troubleshooting research solved this issue .,[]
it had become well and truly a door stop .,[]
wrap up : i exchanged the router for another of the same model .,[]
i was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .,"[('operation', 'pos'), ('firmware update', 'neg')]"
"so i 'll live with the new one as boxed , and never be foolish enough to let netgear try to make it better , ever again .",[]
i see from other reviews that this has been a fairly common issue with this router .,[]
too bad i did n't look here first .,[]
i bought it at best buy without reading the reviews first .,[]
"in the end i would recommend that you go with a different router , if you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .","[('firmware update', 'neg'), ('exchange period', 'pos')]"
bought this router about a month ago to replace an old linksys unit .,[]
i use it primarily for ethernet connections to several computers and one wireless connection to a laptop .,[]
no problems with any of those connections .,"[('connections', 'pos')]"
the laptop is one floor vertically and about 20 feet horizontally away from the router .,[]
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers .,"[('connect', 'pos'), ('feature', 'pos')]"
i am a novice at this stuff but it was extremely easy to set the router up .,"[('set', 'pos')]"
the wireless portion has a `` guest '' setting that allows visitors to access the internet but not your network .,[]
so far the router has worked well .,"[('worked', 'pos')]"
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why ; do n't know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router .,"[('security settings', 'neg')]"
the dd-wrt -lrb- professional -rrb- firmware v24-sp2 build 19152 for the whr-hp-g300n that comes from buffalo 's website does not hold a wireless signal .,[]
"after much frustration , i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd-wrt firmware at dd-wrt 's website and it resolved all my problems .","[('dd-wrt firmware', 'pos')]"
it seems that buffalo does n't put a lot of effort to work on their professional dd-wrt firmwares .,[]
you should use the firmware on the dd-wrt website instead .,"[('firmware', 'pos')]"
it was working good for 4 months .,[]
now even 2.4 ghz signals are not working .,[]
i have to had to keep my laptop within 1 meter radius in order to get the 2.4 ghz signals .,[]
contacted customer support .,[]
they said your 3 months warranty is over .,[]
now i am thinking either buy the expensive warranty or buy another router .,[]
this is my 3rd router from netgear .,[]
the first 2 routers worked good for years .,"[('routers', 'pos')]"
"4 months ago , i bought this and stuck with it .",[]
the customer support is very rude .,"[('customer support', 'neg')]"
i am really surprising how such a mandatory product for every house hold suddently does n't work and the custmer support says you have only 3 months warranty .,[]
and the product was $ 100 and their 1 hour service is $ 55 .,[]
"hopless product , hopeless company and hopeless customer support .","[('product', 'neg'), ('company', 'neg'), ('customer support', 'neg')]"
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it .,"[('set up', 'pos'), ('worked', 'pos')]"
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .,"[('product', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
i bought this router not quite one year ago and am already shopping for it 's replacement .,[]
"it worked reasonably well for a while , although it frequently was barely able to keep up when i tried to stream movies , which was a big part of the reason i went to a faster router in the first place .","[('worked', 'neg')]"
"the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible , sometimes not .","[('usb port', 'neg')]"
"range was comparable to , or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years .","[('range', 'neg')]"
"and finally , in early june , this router stopped broadcasting an internet signal .","[('router', 'neg')]"
"the internal network still functioned , but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem .","[('internet signal', 'neg')]"
i thought it might possibly be the modem or isp until i hooked the old trusty linksys back up to it and it worked fine .,"[('linksys', 'pos')]"
"and now , netgear has deleted their customer service number from their website .",[]
i would too if i was selling garbage like this .,[]
i will be going back to a cisco-linksys product going forward .,[]
"this piece of junk ... well , i 'll probably paint a bullseye on it and take to the range .",[]
it might be good for that .,[]
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds .,"[('connect', 'neg')]"
it would max out at 65 mbps .,[]
"when i reset it , like unplugging it and plugging it back in , i would get the n speeds 150 mbps the first time it connected and would transfer files at that speed , then usually next time i connected it would drop back to 65 or 52 mbps and stay at these speeds .","[('speeds', 'neg')]"
i googled `` d-link dir-655 65 mbps max '' and found that a lot of people are having this problem .,[]
"called their support , they did n't have a clue so i returned it and i am looking for something else that will give me 150 mbps .","[('support', 'neg')]"
purchased this on amazon .,[]
selected it because it looked easy to install .,"[('install', 'pos')]"
followed the directions exactly using the provided cd .,[]
easy enough but it did not work .,"[('work', 'neg')]"
the interface was atrocious ; several elements simply did n't work at all .,"[('interface', 'neg')]"
called netgear tech and they walked me through an additional lenghtly proceedure .,[]
worked fine after that .,"[('worked', 'pos')]"
i have very high praise for the tech support people .,"[('tech support people', 'pos')]"
he was very patient with me .,[]
i am extremely happy with the reault .,[]
the device is small and well designed ... i would recomment it highly,"[('device', 'pos'), ('small', 'pos'), ('designed', 'pos')]"
i purchased a m-10 valet router and had the following experience .,[]
the wrong router was in the box -lrb- new not refurb -rrb- .,[]
since it would not work as advertised i called support .,"[('work', 'neg')]"
"the software said the unit had the wrong serial number , and the wrong model .",[]
the tech continued however to try to make it work .,[]
at this point i had no idea they had put the wrong unit in the box .,[]
after a few hours the tech said this would have to go to an engineer .,[]
meanwhile most of the units functions did not work .,[]
i reinstalled my old router .,[]
i then discovered that it was the wrong hardware .,[]
"i called again and was told i could send it back rma and wait for a new unit , purchase another and they would do a credit card hold until they got the unit back .",[]
or i could return it to the store .,[]
after about 5 hours of frustration i did not feel any love for these choices .,[]
"they caused the problem , ie wrong product in the box , the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong .","[('service tech', 'neg')]"
"i did get appologies -lrb- canned -rrb- , the case number was 120118-004972 if someone at cisco that cares reads this .",[]
this router is awesom but it will only support 1 xbox we have 3 and you can never get more than 1 to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and 1 360 you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money,"[('router', 'pos')]"
"does what it should , wish everything i bought did this .",[]
owned for 2.5 months and never had to reset yet .,[]
this router gets 1 star from me due to it 's disconnect issue .,"[('disconnect', 'neg')]"
"have the latest firmware but as many others have described , the router will randomly stop working for 5 minutes then work again .","[('router', 'neg')]"
experience this about 1-2 times a week .,[]
"not a big issue if you are n't doing anything time pressing , but if you 're trying to get that last minute auction or are playing a competitive game you get screwed .",[]
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -lrb- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -rrb- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .,"[('price', 'neg'), ('quality', 'neg')]"
"item shipped out quickly , was in good condition , came with easy to use set-up disk ... we have n't had to 're - set ' the router at all so far since it 's delivery , so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop ... added security benefits , neighbors no longer hogging signal , well worth the purchase price !","[('shipped out', 'pos'), ('condition', 'pos'), ('set-up disk', 'pos')]"

"-lrb- lost internet connection with the router , internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem -rrb- .","[('internet connection', 'neg')]"
my first service call lasted over an hour -lrb- 46 minutes follwed by a call back that lasted about 25 minutes . -rrb-,[]
"i was guided through several attempts to find a solution , finally resetting and reloading some software .",[]
"this worked -lrb- for a few days -rrb- four days later , same failure .",[]
"following the same procedure , restored operation .",[]
"a few days after that , another failure , same conditions .",[]
i replaced the router with another brand and called for a refund or return material authorization -lrb- rma -rrb- from netgear .,[]
got the runaround .,[]
"i called again this morning was put on hold by a technician , and the call was terminated .",[]
"i called again and spoke to a supervisor who finally agreed to replace the unit if i mailed it in to netgear , then they would mail a replacement .",[]
no refunds are allowed !!!!!,[]
"for such a key part of a system , to have to wait for a swap by mail is unacceptable , it should be return to the retailer for an immediate swap .",[]
"i have learned a great deal about netgear 's warranty policy through this experience , and will avoid this brand at all costs .",[]
i guess that `` limited lifetime warranty '' means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty .,"[('warranty', 'neg')]"
bottom line : it did n't work the way it was supposed to so we 're returning it we bought this router for our two computers .,"[('work', 'neg')]"
one is a new laptop running vista and the other is a 7 year old desktop with windows 2000 .,[]
our two requirements of a router were 1 -rrb- it should work with both vista and 2000 and 2 -rrb- it should have a usb port so that we can connect the printer .,[]
"you ca n't share a printer between 2000 and vista , so we 've always just had the printer hooked up to the desktop .",[]
"everytime you want to print from the laptop , you have to carry it across the house to the printer .",[]
"sometimes , with the old router , the laptop was able to see and access the shared drives on the desktop and we could move and print things that way , but that only worked some of the time .",[]
we wanted to find a better solution .,[]
my husband and i are both software engineers .,[]
"if two software engineers ca n't get this working with our system , then it 's not going to work with what we have .",[]
"we spent probably 12 hours , total , trying to get the router 's usb port to work with no luck .",[]
"first , i tried to set the router up using the wire connection to the old desktop .",[]
i spent 4 hours on that and i could n't connect to the internet .,"[('connect', 'neg')]"
i tried setting the router up with the laptop and it connected easily and hooked me up to the internet in under 15 minutes .,"[('connected', 'pos')]"
"when i then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly , the internet connection was just fine .","[('internet connection', 'pos')]"
"so if you are trying to use this router with two different operating systems , set it up using the computer that has the newest os and you 'll hopefully be successful .",[]
"once i had the internet working on both computers , i installed the software , shareport network usb , from the disk provided with the router .",[]
neither computer could see the printer in the usb port .,[]
"to rule out that it was a printer issue , i plugged a thumb drive into the usb port and neither computer could see that either .",[]
"i downloaded the newest version of shareport , tried it on both computers , no luck .",[]
"tried many combinations of rebooting the router , the modem , each computer , etc. .",[]
no luck .,[]
"i installed new firmware versions , one by one , on the router and kept trying .",[]
no dice .,[]
read many online forums .,[]
still no luck .,[]
tried beta firmware versions which were supposed to fix the problem .,[]
the computers never could see the usb port .,[]
our old router works with both windows 2000 and vista .,[]

"however , shareport on this new router worked 0 % of the time .","[('shareport', 'neg')]"
we 're going to go back to our old router because some of the time is better than never .,[]
finally went wireless and this was the router i chose for my 2 story house .,[]
its a hit !,[]
"son is on ipod all the time , wife watching tv on laptop , me online gaming on desktop -lrb- i did increase my bandwith from my internet provider when i did this -rrb- all at the same time and you would never know the difference if they werent .",[]
"when i installed it i called my internet provider and they walked me through it , so dont feel like you need to know anything at all about installing one of these , cause you dont .",[]
all you need to know is this is what you need if you want to go wireless and you need to cover a good size home .,[]
this is the router for those who want to save some $ $ $ by not ` renting ' from a cable firm .,[]
"this is an outstanding product , one that lives up to the pr .","[('product', 'pos')]"
"my mom , -lrb- in her 70 's -rrb- bought this for herself , and as a gift to me - say goodbye to hard router set-up 's .",[]
"valet plus is easy to configure , and was set up in about 7 minutes .","[('valet plus', 'pos'), ('configure', 'pos')]"
the product pretty much set 's itself up - unlike other brands\/products .,[]
"the range is great - upstairs , downstairs , outside , or in a basement - four bars , all the time .","[('range', 'pos')]"
"if you are a bit shy about setting up a router\/network , this is the one for you .",[]
"the set-up is goof-proof , and offers a superior result .","[('set-up', 'pos')]"
super easy !,[]
-lrb- really -rrb- .,[]
i had a xycel x550 that i replaced with the d-link dir-655 .,[]
x550 was a fine router .,[]
just getting a little old .,[]
went with the dir-655 .,[]
worked fine .,"[('worked', 'pos')]"
"17 months later , it died .",[]
almost threw it away .,[]
probably like many others as i had no easy way to test the adapter .,[]
you ca n't just plug one adapter in to something else .,[]
especially due to the odd sized plug designed by d-link .,"[('plug', 'neg')]"
intentional ?,[]
you tell me ?,[]
tested it with a volt meter .,[]
dead .,[]
"so , i looked on line to buy one and guess what ?",[]
no one sells a 1.2 mm x 2.2 mm sized -lrb- or what ever stupid size it is -rrb- power adapter .,"[('size', 'neg')]"
"they made these small , i can only guess , because it is a possible revenue generator ?",[]
new ones are ~ $ 15 .,[]
and they will too likely die a short death as well .,[]
"in fact , i have never had a power adapter die before my actual product before .",[]
"so now , i will buy a - \/ + 12v 2.5 amp or 3amp power adapter or brick and splice this stupid sized end on it .",[]
d-links only recourse is to buy a new power adapter .,[]
nearly impossible to find one of this end size ... unless you buy their replacement product ... netgear or zyxel for me .,[]
do not buy \/ avoid,[]
i have owned the `` wndr3700 '' for about six months and it does a good job at 1 gbps direct connection and up to 300 mbps wireless .,[]
now they come out with the wndr4500 that offers 900 mbps .,[]
do n't cha just love the old technological trickle .,[]
as far as performance my very old linksys 54g worked fine with a strong signal and a solid 54 mbps wireless .,[]
i had no problem running my tv apps with it or using my laptop wirelessly .,[]
i mainly got the 3700 for the usb port that allows for bookoo storage on my network .,[]
"in another 6 mos they will surely come out with a router that will do 2000 mbps -lrb- not that they do n't already have it , they just do n't want to release it , , , , yet -rrb- and everybody will run to get one .",[]

"it is infuriating , frustrating , and disruptive to my workflow .",[]
"it takes approximately 20 to 90 seconds to come back online -lrb- i have n't timed it -rrb- , which does n't sound that bad until you get nailed 10 times in one hour -lrb- that 's about as bad as it gets ; sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting -rrb- .","[('come back online', 'neg')]"
"according to various forums , lots of people have this problem -lrb- just google `` dir-655 rebooting '' -rrb- , and there does n't seem to be a consensus on a solution .",[]

this happens when my laptop is the only computer on its network .,[]
i have not contacted dlink .,[]

i recommend buying another product until this long running issue -lrb- i 've seen posts from 2007 -rrb- is resolved .,[]
i read most of the reviews and checked out others before i bought this one .,[]
it is everything people had reviewed this to be .,[]
very satisfied .,[]
i did buy the square trade extended warranty just in case .,[]
i got this with a windows 7 home premium 3-pack .,[]
"since it was really a giveaway from microsoft , i did n't expect much .",[]
however the setup was easy and the results excellent .,"[('setup', 'pos')]"
i have been dealing with wireless routers and access points for a long time -lrb- most recently with cisco\/linksys -rrb- and this was the easiest most efficient setup i 've ever experienced .,"[('setup', 'pos')]"
what a pleasure !,[]
and it works great too !,"[('works', 'pos')]"

the ipad also does not have a usb port so i could n't use my verizon novatel usb760 3g usb dongle modem that i use with my laptop for those hotels without free internet service .,[]
i looked at the wifi hotspot type products but most of those require a 1-2 year contact and can cost up to $ 40-60 per month for the data service which adds up fast over a 12 month period .,[]
this device solves the problem nicely .,"[('device', 'pos')]"
it can be attached to the hotel cat-5 cable or can accept several different usb 3g modems to create a local wifi hotspot that the ipad or ipod type devices can use as well as my laptop using it 's wifi connection .,[]
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box .,"[('setup', 'pos')]"
if you want to set up security so that no one nearby can `` share '' your hotspot that can be done using the web browser interface common with all routers .,[]
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input .,"[('speeds', 'pos')]"
unfortunately my verizon 3g signal strength where i live is very weak -lrb- 1-2 bars -rrb- so i could n't get much more than 1 mbps download speed but i will test this again when i am in a location with decent signal strength .,"[('signal strength', 'neg')]"
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often .,"[('product', 'pos')]"
only issue is with updating firmware .,"[('updating firmware', 'neg')]"
my attempts at upgrading using netgear genie corrupted the existing firmware .,[]
i had to manually restore the firmware .,[]
the procedure for restoring corrupted firmware is not easy to find .,[]
this is a replacement to an older netgear 11b\/g rangemax router that i have had for a few years .,[]
"it was a snap to set up and my ps3 , asus eee netbook , droid 2 , and pcs all connect without issue .","[('set up', 'pos')]"
"the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around 72mb\/s , even when in the same room .","[('speed', 'neg')]"
maybe i just need to play with the settings a little more .,[]
"also , it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear .","[('set up', 'pos')]"
"i really , really wanted to like the dir-655 .",[]
it had most every feature i wanted -lrb- though dual-band n would have been nice - one needs the much more expensive 855 for that -rrb- .,[]
"unfortunately , i just could not get it to work .","[('work', 'neg')]"
"the problem is that it would not acquire an ip address by dhcp from my isp , verizon fios .",[]
"using the same mac address did n't help , neither did making sure the ip was released from the old router before connecting the new one .",[]
"i had an old netgear router around and it got an ip immediately , as did my notebook when i connected it directly .",[]
i returned the dir-655 and got a second unit - same exact problem .,[]
"d-link support was polite and tried to help , but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful .","[('support', 'neg')]"
"a web search revealed that this model has a history of dhcp ip acquisition problems , though not everyone sees it .",[]
"i read reports of a european firmware update that resolved the problem for some , but it did n't for me .",[]
"i 've never encountered a router problem like this before , and have had probably six or seven over the years .",[]
"sadly , i returned the 655 for a refund and will keep looking .",[]
"i know that many are very happy with this product , even those using verizon fios , but just be aware that you may be as unlucky as i was .",[]
edit : december 2008 .,[]
"i decided to try again , this time with the dir-825 -lrb- simultaneous dual-band and some added features i liked . -rrb-",[]
same problem - no dhcp .,[]
"this time , d-link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem , which was that the router failed to `` auto-negotiate '' the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block .","[('support', 'pos')]"
no other router or pc i had tried had such a problem .,[]
the second-level support rep had me change the speed to 10mbps -lrb- instead of the default 10\/100\/1000 auto -rrb- and it worked .,[]
"well , sort of .",[]
what 's the point of a 15mbps service with a 10mbps ethernet link ?,[]
could i set it to 100mbps ?,[]
yes .,[]
did it work ?,[]
no. .,[]
but i then had a think .,[]
i grabbed an ethernet switch i had elsewhere in the house and put that between the fios connection and the router .,[]
success !,[]
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link .,"[('switch', 'pos')]"
so off to local store i go and i find the same model netgear gige switch on sale for $ 30 .,[]
install that and i 'm in business .,[]
"if i had realized this when i had the dir-655 i might have stuck with it , but that does raise the price by 30 % .",[]
"if the dir-655 does the auto-negotiation for you properly , then that 's great .",[]
"if not , you can install a switch or look for another brand .",[]
i conclude that the ethernet transceiver d-link uses is not as good as that of other brands .,"[('ethernet transceiver', 'neg')]"
i am not to savy with a computer but the d-link is very easy to install and set up .,"[('install', 'pos'), ('set up', 'pos')]"
"i have had no problems with it yet , and i can us my ipod anywhere in the house .",[]
"had a lot of problems with the dd-wrt advanced setup , but called tech support , after 45 minutes of holding , and switch to the user friendly firmware and was up and going in no time .",[]
belive there is a problem with my firmware for the dd-wrt .,[]
"not a very impressive signal , can only get one maybe two bars and maybe 48mbs .",[]
still good enough to stream video .,[]
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted 4 months .,"[('signals', 'pos')]"
i bought this one for the supposed extended range and external antenna .,[]
so much for range though .,[]
it was better with my old linksys .,[]
"overall , not a bad buy .",[]
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone .,"[('tech support', 'pos')]"
i bought this product in feb 2011 to replace my old dlink router .,[]
i thought this new model should bring up speed and be reliable by having new n & g mode .,[]
"it worked perfectly for about a week , then the problems came .","[('worked', 'pos')]"
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped .,"[('connection', 'neg')]"
"i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware , but this did not solve the problem .","[('tech support', 'neg')]"
they said the product was defective and said they would send a new one .,"[('product', 'neg')]"
"after that arrived , i was to send the old one to them .",[]
"however , the day before the new replacement router arrived , our original router started to work like it did the first day we bought it .",[]
"the connection was smooth , did n't drop all the time , and was much faster .",[]
"however , the day the replacement router arrived , things got complicated .",[]
"the replacement was even worse than the original one , which was now working fine .","[('working', 'pos')]"
"we had already agree to return the original one , but that was the one that actually worked .",[]
i am disappointed in this product .,"[('product', 'neg')]"
"it is too much of a hassle , so next time , i will buy routers from a different company .",[]
i am using this wireless router for video streaming devices in my house .,[]
the data line connected to the router is in the front room and there are several wireless devices throughout the house .,[]
the first router i had was not fast enough to handle my video streaming needs .,[]
this router works fine and i am able to stream video in all rooms of the house at the same time .,"[('works', 'pos'), ('router', 'pos')]"
this router works very well right out of the box .,"[('router', 'pos'), ('works', 'pos')]"
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house .,"[('coverage', 'pos')]"
one reason i purchased this model was that we could print from the router 's usb without the need for a host computer to be running .,[]
"in that regard , i am still having difficulty attempting to get the shareport utility to function normally .","[('shareport utility', 'neg')]"
the shareport manual and help screens are very minimalistic .,[]
this router is phenomenal !,"[('router', 'pos')]"
it is a router designed for open source community .,[]
i replaced a linksys wrt54gl running tomato firmware ver .,[]

i have the netgear wnr3500l running the latest tomato firmware from -lrb- ... -rrb- it is a modified firmware from the stock tomato firmware from -lrb- ... -rrb- .,[]
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server .,"[('usb interface', 'pos')]"

the router has 4port 1gig ethernet switch and wireless access point ap -rrb- 802.11 n working flawlessly !,"[('working', 'pos')]"
"not for the faint of heart , but recommended for the user who loves to build networks .",[]
router also works with dd-wrt firmware .,[]
this router has a web site dedicated for the users of this router .,[]
check it out at -lrb- ... -rrb- .,[]
"in short , if you 're just someone that 's a little afraid of technology , and you just want a router to get online , do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day , this router is great for you .","[('router', 'pos')]"
"more than likely , if you are forking over the money for this router , you have higher needs and expectations , which this router does n't meet .","[('router', 'neg')]"
my experiences are as follows ... i wanted to upgrade my old linksys router -lrb- wrt54g -rrb- to something a little bit more on par with todays technology .,[]
"with our new hp home mediaserver -lrb- ex495 -rrb- serving out our files , our 2 laptops , 2 desktops , 2 ps3 's , 1 xbox , and our slew of netflix junkies , we especially needed something with gigabit speeds for all the internal network trafic that was going on .",[]
guest network .,[]
"first i was a bit suprised when i saw this , and i thought it would be a great idea for our next door neighbor that we share our network with for a small monthly fee .",[]
"simply pop her on it , and not have to worry about her stumbling on our shared media .",[]
"well the theory was great , but upon enabling the guest network , things stopped working .","[('guest network', 'neg')]"
"with it enabled , anytime we made changes to the router , we had to manually press the `` turn on radio '' button on the front of the router because the gui one would n't work .","[('gui', 'neg')]"
this would be okay i suppose ... if it worked .,[]
"any time we turned on the guest network , all of our default networking died so we ended up turning off this feature and pretending like we never found it and got all suprised in the first place .",[]
upnp .,[]
"in short , it does n't work -lrb- properly -rrb- .",[]
our mediaserver has an option to program our router for the port forwarding for remote access .,[]
the old router -lrb- wrt54g -rrb- worked fine .,[]
i manually ended up forwarding the ports and this worked fine .,[]
usb network storage - `` supposedly '' it 's slow .,"[('usb network storage', 'neg')]"
i 'd tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this .,"[('router', 'neg')]"
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow .,"[('slow', 'neg')]"
"hey , i like to make my own opinions .",[]
"slow gui - be prepared to wait approximately 90 seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded `` apply '' button ... yes , 1�1\/2 minutes !","[('slow', 'neg')]"
----------------- speeds\/throughput : i did n't have any complaints .,[]
it was nice to have the faster internal network speeds while we tested this router -lrb- which was for all of about 3 hours while trying to get everything to work properly -rrb- .,"[('network speeds', 'pos')]"
"due to the lack of support for whs \/ upnp \/ guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , i was very unimpressed .","[('support', 'neg'), ('router', 'neg')]"
i could have spent -lrb- $ 50 and gotten a router that did everything this one was able to do .,[]
"had this one done what it claimed , i 'd have been very satisfied ... note : my problems were on both the initial bios -lrb- v1 .0.4.43 na -rrb- and on the upgraded latest bios -lrb- v1 .0.4.55 na -rrb-",[]

"i am so happy my old , non-netgear router died on me after less than one year out of the box !",[]
"otherwise , how many years would i have been stuck with poor wifi performance and not know it ?",[]
bought this along with a roku .,[]
the dir-655 was so easy to setup it was almost too easy .,"[('setup', 'pos')]"

great purchase .,[]
update 2011\/12\/2 : going strong for half a month now .,[]
"as far as i recall , no reboots , or maybe one for an unrelated reason .",[]
i am raising my rating from one star to three stars .,[]
it would have been four if i would n't have had to go through all of this hassle to get it to work right .,[]
netgear should have left well enough alone with firmware v1 .0.4.55 na and hardware version 1 .,[]
update 2011\/11\/15 : smallnetbuilder dot com stuck with firmware version v1 .0.4.55 na according to one of their articles that referenced the wndr3700v1 test results .,[]
that version was still available on netgear 's support site -lrb- just click `` show all versions '' -rrb- .,[]
i loaded that with the following ritual : hold reset switch 30 seconds with power on -lrb- still 1.0.16.98-dnsna firmware -rrb- .,[]
"keep holding , turn power off , hold for 30 seconds while power is off .",[]
"still holding , turn power on .",[]
then turn power off and let go of reset switch and wait 10 seconds .,[]
"boot up , leave on for at least two minutes , and do software factory reset -lrb- from backup menu in web gui -rrb- .",[]
let it reboot .,[]
then upload and install v1 .0.4.55 na from web gui .,[]
then do a software reset again .,[]
then re-upload and install v1 .0.4.55 na .,[]
i do n't know if all of this is really necessary .,[]
it is my compilation of all the posted paranoia out there .,[]
"now set up your preferred ssid names , port forwards , dhcp range , etc. .",[]
i did n't change any of the qos or wan settings .,[]
i left nat as secure .,[]
"i set up the 2.4 ghz radio as g -lrb- 54mb\/s -rrb- with wep , the 5ghz radio as n single band -lrb- 130mb\/s -rrb- , wpa2 personal aes .",[]
you can probably set it up for 300mb\/s -lrb- double wide -rrb- if you want .,[]
now everything with youtube and iptv have been fine for about a day .,[]
l already received an rma number .,[]
"but if all goes well for another couple of days , i 'll keep the unit .",[]
"if not and i return it , i will let you know here .",[]
"the rationale behind the paranoid flash procedure is to make sure that another firmware version 's setup -lrb- usually a slightly different size when backup-stored , with slightly different options -rrb- does n't corrupt the the new firmware footprint -lrb- i guess -rrb- .",[]
"i do n't know if someone had a rational method of coming up with it -lrb- e.g. , ex-netgear engineer with some inside knowledge -rrb- or it was just someone 's gut feeling .",[]
end of update .,[]
i searched out a wndr3700 version 1 because that is the version that got rave reviews at smallnetbuilder.com .,[]
-lrb- netgear screwed up the version 2 by skimping on the antenna array . -rrb-,[]
i found this `` refurb '' version 1 and thought i had lucked out .,[]
the seller was very helpful in making sure i got the right version .,[]
"i suspect netgear takes defective returns , wraps them in new plastic , and labels them `` refurb , '' and hopes they work or that whatever defect they had would not be noticed by the new buyer .",[]
"for some reason , they scratch out the serial number to signal that they wo n't support their refurbs .",[]
why not ?,[]
cisco-linksys leaves serial numbers on refurbs and give them limited warranties .,[]
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does n't know what to do .,"[('firmware', 'neg')]"
this router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed iptv from hulu plus would slow down and freeze or stutter .,"[('slowed down', 'neg')]"
"i tried at least three versions of firmware and continued to have the same problem -lrb- 1.0.6.98 na as shipped , and then 1.0.7.98 na , 1.0.4.68 na , and finally the latest 1.0.16.98-dnsna -rrb- .",[]
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires .,"[('labeling of firmware', 'neg')]"
what happened to everything between 1.0.7 .,[]
x and 1.0.16 .,[]
x for example ?,[]
and why was 1.0.16.98 label reused for the beta 1.0.16.98-dnsna instead of calling it 1.0.16.99 na ?,[]
"also , the auto-update only shows up to 1.0.7.98 .",[]
"the internet is filled with similar complaints about slow downs and freezes , trying various firmwares , and doing various magic spell rituals before upgrading -lrb- holding reset button for 10 seconds , or 30 seconds , or doing it twice , unplugging with reset pushed , and so on -rrb- .",[]
i tried the most burdensome rituals in case there was something to them .,[]
"just in case anyone gets one of these , the only way i could get even initial acceptable results in youtube was to change the nat setting from `` secure '' to `` open . ''",[]
not so safe .,[]
i have applied to return this piece of garbage .,[]
it is back to my old linksys wrt600n with dd-wrt for now .,[]
"my only complaint about that dinosaur is that it suddenly looses the 5ghz wireless connection when streaming a lot of video , probably because of overheating .",[]
it is about 3 years old .,[]

"i have several computers on my network -lrb- imac , mac book , and 2 xp laptops -rrb- , my ipod , airport , wireless printer and a nas with two 500gb hd 's .",[]
i choose the valet router for the simple reason that i do not want to know nor do i care about port 21 or other it stuff .,[]
it just has to work .,[]
and it did n't .,[]
i spent 1.5 hours on the phone with their tech support -lrb- you get connected right away and do n't have to wait -rrb- and got at least my imac and macbook back online .,"[('tech support', 'pos')]"
the printer still does n't work and the airport is also not working yet .,[]
i got really upset when they got someone on the line who was supposed to help me with my nas200 -lrb- which is also a cisco product -rrb- and then i was told that they are going to charge me for premium customer support .,[]
"at this point i had spent already 2 hours on the phone for a product , which was supposed to be `` plug and play '' .",[]
"i guess i do n't have to mention that i do not recommend this product , that i most likely will return it and keep my fingers off cisco\/linksys stuff in future .","[('product', 'neg')]"
update : i spent another hour with the tech support to get my windows laptop set up .,[]
"the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses , firewalls and numerous other programs .","[('router', 'neg')]"
total time spent on the phone to set up the network : 3,[]
upgraded from linksys g to use my roku hd\/xr box .,[]
easy set up .,"[('set up', 'pos')]"
admin options are more that you would ever need .,[]
set up wpa with no problems .,"[('set up', 'pos')]"
great coverage .,"[('coverage', 'pos')]"
even works better on g band than the linksys .,"[('works', 'pos')]"
two thumbs up .,[]
i bought this router so that i could give internet access to both my desktop pc and my new macbook pro laptop .,[]
"after a few hours , and a call to my internet service provider , i accomplished this very basic task .",[]
-lrb- i use verizon dsl and discovered that i needed to go through some steps before the router would be recognized by my isp . -rrb-,[]
"unfortunately , the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice -- not fun .","[('installation software', 'neg')]"
"meanwhile , the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd-rom , but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers .","[('instructions', 'neg')]"
it turns out my apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed .,[]
it turns out my apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed .,[]
i wish someone had told me that when i started this process !,[]
"but getting the router up and running is just the first hassle - you also have to get your new network password protected , otherwise anyone can join it .",[]
here i had major problems - no one should have to wade through complicated terminology like wep and wap and lord knows what else just to enable a simple password protection for a home network .,[]
"it should just be a one-step automatic process , rather than requiring us to go boldly into advanced setup screens full of techno-gibberish .",[]
"the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap , it 's only a trial version -- you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional $ 40-60 to some unknown company to unlock all the features !","[('software', 'pos')]"
"not only that , but you ca n't even use the trial demo on macs - in order make printer sharing work , you have to buy the full version for macs -lrb- but not for pcs -rrb- .",[]
that is absurd and downright deceptive .,[]
"exasperated at 3 am , i called it quits and will be sending this awful , deceptive product back .","[('product', 'neg')]"
i only hope this review spares one person from a similar strife .,[]
this is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !,"[('product', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
the 802.11 draft n-protocol made a huge difference from the super-g which showed obselete in comparison .,[]
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets .,"[('router', 'pos')]"
"reliable , highly available and ease of administration and forget about me -lrb- do n't bother anymore -rrb- equipment !","[('administration', 'pos')]"
i am lucky to have bought it and using it in my house thanks ihsan,[]
i bought this dual band router to replace my old cisco wrt45g router .,[]
"it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices -lrb- 2 laptops , 1 desktop and 2 smartphones -rrb- connected to the internet in minutes .","[('set up', 'pos')]"
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically .,"[('internet connection', 'neg')]"
every few minutes wireless devices would stop receiving data from the router .,[]
"i called the tech support who took me through a few scripted steps -lrb- upgrade firmware , downgrade firmware , set a permanent channel etc. -rrb- ; none of these suggestions worked .",[]
a number of angry phone calls router netgear agreed to replace my wndr3700v2 router with a refurbished wndr3700v1 router .,[]
the new router worked well for 2 months after which it had failed .,"[('router', 'neg')]"
i am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .,"[('router', 'neg'), ('connection', 'neg')]"
its annoying when you pay $ 100 + for a router and it does n't work as it is supposed straight out of the box !,"[('router', 'neg')]"
i am so tired of netgear 's product quality & customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know .,"[('quality', 'neg'), ('customer service', 'neg')]"
"all in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .","[('device', 'neg'), ('customer service', 'neg')]"
set up went pretty well and things seemed good .,"[('set up', 'pos')]"
then the box began rebooting itself every 1-3 hours .,[]
support suggested power problems .,[]
"while this may seem logical , their recommendation made no sense : bypass the ups and plug it directly into the wall , `` just to see what happens . ''",[]
same problem .,[]
i replaced the box with another n600 from another store in the theory that that bad box gets through once and a while .,[]
same problem .,[]
i dumped the 2nd box and bought a zoom x7n at half the price and have no problems with it at all .,[]
"i try had to make it work but it never ... sad about it the lights dont go green , only red",[]
it does everything it says .,[]
it is a wonderful little router .,"[('router', 'pos')]"
"commputer , laptop and tv hooked up to it .",[]
no problems .,[]
just once in a while like your modem you need to unplug and reboot everything .,[]
par for the norm .,[]
would highly recommend,[]
works -lrb- almost -rrb- exactly as advertised .,[]
"setup required one phone call to tech support , during which it was determined that i had not completely re-set my cable modem -lrb- it has a backup battery , so simply disconnecting the power cord was n't enough - i had to remove the backup battery , too -rrb- .",[]
"once that was done , connectivity was instananeous , and setting up the 2 other computers -lrb- a mac and a pc -rrb- in the house literally took 5 minutes in total .",[]
"connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router i replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus , this makes for a great product .","[('connection speed', 'pos'), ('product', 'pos')]"
highly recommended - well worth the $ $ .,[]
this router is the best i have used to date .,"[('router', 'pos')]"
there may be others that perform as well .,[]
"however , if speed , reliability , and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements , then this router will do the job .","[('speed', 'pos'), ('reliability', 'pos'), ('transmit a signal', 'pos')]"
worked great until the new firmware that installs securespot .,"[('worked', 'pos'), ('firmware', 'neg')]"
"when the securespot free trial finishes , they ask you to buy it and when you do n't , it stops working well .","[('working', 'neg')]"
"even when you disable securespot completely , it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is n't and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized .","[('securespot', 'neg')]"
after 20 rounds of that over the last year i gave up and ordered a router from another company .,[]
you may ask why not go back to the old firmware .,[]
"you ca n't , that `` upgrade '' is irreversible .","[('upgrade', 'neg')]"
d-link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .,"[('d-link', 'neg'), ('product', 'neg')]"
"i purchased this netgear router 6 months ago to replace an older model linksys router with antennas , which had replaced an even older linksys , also with antennas .",[]
"it 's difficult to make a comparison due to the fact that the linksys was using a ` g ' band , while i 'm using the ` n ' band on this netgear - although both are at 2.4 ghz .",[]
but i can say the netgear has more signal strength .,[]
"i actually have it sitting flat , rather than upright .",[]
i would say signal strength has increased by 1\/3 at the least - and it 's consistent .,[]
"the wifi is approximately 21 + yards away -lrb- on the same ground floor -rrb- , going through 4 walls at full signal strength .",[]
"setup was easy -lrb- windows xp wired , windows 7 professional wifi -rrb- .","[('setup', 'pos')]"
"the software disc -lrb- which is the setup wizard -rrb- included is not windows 7 compatible , although you can download it at netgear 's site .",[]
i did n't bother with it .,[]
"i followed the easy instructions in the manual , and once online at the router 's login , there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it .","[('instructions', 'pos')]"
"i just set it up manually , which is very easy .","[('set', 'pos')]"
"the router recognized my other wifi devices easily , and further setup was a breeze .","[('setup', 'pos')]"
my linksys froze for 30 minutes or longer when applying changes .,"[('linksys', 'neg')]"
the netgear does so within a few seconds .,[]
"having dual bands is a bonus , although currently i do not have any ` n ' band 5.0 ghz capable devices - and have disabled the 5.0 ghz for now ... but it 's there for the future .",[]
i do n't wish to repeat all the options this router offers as others have already done so in good detail .,[]
"i would however like to emphasize a few basic things for those unfamiliar with router setups : 1 -rrb- once you are connected , do upgrade the firmware before proceeding .",[]
"2 -rrb- please , please change the login password from the default -lrb- listed in the manual which comes with the router -rrb- to your own .",[]
half my neighbors have not .,[]
"this is just basic and so easily done - and will keep others from piggybacking , or worse yet , logging into your router and changing the settings and using their own login password to lock you out -lrb- if this has already happened you 'll need to reset your router manually and start all over -rrb- .",[]
"once you login to the router 's address , you 'll find it listed under maintenance at set password .",[]
keep track of all your passwords !,[]
"one of my neighbors could no longer gain access to the internet and blamed it on the router ... i had seen that it was initially not secured , and later secure .",[]
i 'm guessing a neighboring kid just decided to mess around .,[]
fortunately they mentioned this to me -lrb- before just buying another router -rrb- and i helped them get back online .,[]
2a -rrb- set up a secure connection .,[]
"again , i `` see '' too many who have n't set any type of security .",[]
"at your netgear router login page , go to setup , and underneath are options for both wireless settings -lrb- your wifi -rrb- and guest network .",[]
type in your own ssid -lrb- name -rrb- - do n't leave it at the default name .,[]
"set up a security option and type in your own passphrase password ... it is strongly recommended you not use wep for the guest network if this can be avoided -lrb- i do n't think this netgear even has wep for wireless settings , but it does for the guest network -rrb- .",[]
"again , keep a record of these .",[]
"use strong passwords , both uppercase and lowercase letters , mixed with numbers and symbols - and make it long .",[]
"just these basic steps should keep neighbors and drive-by 's from piggybacking your connection , which at the least can slow down your internet connection speed or cause intermittent loss of connectivity if you have quite a few piggybackers .",[]
remember to occasionally login to see if there are any upgrades for your router .,[]
"i 'm very happy with this router , and would recommend it .","[('router', 'pos')]"
i will update later should i run into any problems .,[]
update : i 've been using this router for 3 months and it 's still working very well - wifi remains strong and consistant .,"[('working', 'pos')]"
i do use the power button frequently -lrb- hold it about 2-3 seconds to power on\/off for wifi .,[]
can even use the power button if laptops are booted and our internet connection is almost immediate .,[]
i remain extremely pleased with this router !,"[('router', 'pos')]"
advertised as d-link extreme over 300 mbs .,[]
it works fine but performance is no better than my old smc g 54mbs .,"[('works', 'pos'), ('performance', 'neg')]"
"i was really excited to finally get an n router , an upgrade from my linksys wireless g wrt54g2 .",[]
"first thing i tested was the speed , and i have to say it was abysmal .","[('speed', 'neg')]"
"on a wired connection with my linksys , speedtest.net rated my home pc with a connection of up to 25mbps connection and wireless speeds around 15 mbps .",[]
"hooked up to the d-link extreme n , connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps .","[('speed', 'neg')]"
and this one is extreme .,[]
at first i dealt with this as 18mbps was still really fast .,"[('fast', 'pos')]"
"the next day , i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network , but no internet connection .","[('internet connection', 'neg')]"
"i had read in other reviews that it dropped their internet connection every couple of days so at the first sign of this happening to me , i got an rma and shipped it back .",[]
save your money .,[]
"go with another brand , i know if i ever bight the bullet for another n router , it will be a linksys .",[]
this is a good product .,"[('product', 'pos')]"
not cheap but not expensive either .,"[('cheap', 'neg'), ('expensive', 'pos')]"
i installed it directly from windows 7 in about three minutes .,[]
it was in operation within five minutes .,[]
it has very good range -- much better than the linksys router it replaced .,"[('range', 'pos')]"
it covers three floors with no difficulty .,[]
i am the home network administrator\/complaint department .,[]
there have been no complaints from my `` customers '' -lrb- my daughters who use the 5-g channel with their powerbooks -rrb- .,[]
it has a usb port -- so you can plug in a usb-powered drive and have network-accessible storage .,"[('usb port', 'pos')]"
i highly recommend it .,[]
"i have been using this router for about 2 years now , since october 2008 .",[]
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .,"[('firmware', 'pos'), ('router', 'pos')]"
good range & speed .,"[('range', 'pos'), ('speed', 'pos')]"
i highly recommend .,[]
i bought this to replace an old linksys that would not cooperate with my new canon printer .,[]
"the price was the lowest i 'd seen in my research -lrb- best buy , office depot -rrb- .","[('price', 'pos')]"
it was a snap to insert the install thumb drive which walked me through the install for my mac and then the printer and our two iphones .,[]
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive .,"[('use', 'pos'), ('instructions', 'pos')]"
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link .,"[('guest feature', 'pos')]"
background - i 'll provide some background so that people can put my comments in context .,[]
"first , i have what i consider an average understanding of computers and home network technology .",[]
i wired my house with a cat 5e ethernet system .,[]
"my home network now includes 3 desktops , 1 netbook , 2 laptops , ipods , network printer , network attached storage device -lrb- 2tb raidx -rrb- , patch panel , 8-port switch , router , and cable modem .",[]
"the patch panel , switch , router , and modem are located in a panel in the basement where all my computer , video , and phone cables originate .",[]
"with the recent addition of the netbook and ipods , i decided to add a wireless access point for greater mobility .",[]
"i wanted a device with good range , data transfer capacity , and security .",[]
i could n't care less about `` peripheral '' features that are often bundled with todays routers such as the nas capabilities .,[]
keep that in mind with respect to my evaluation of this product .,[]
"on a side note , i have operated on windows xp and found it a real struggle to manage all the various permissions between different users and devices .",[]
i am in the process of upgrading to windows 7 and find the network features much easier .,[]
"if you have an extensive home network , windows 7 is worth the upgrade .",[]
appearance - now for the buffalo nfinity whr-hp-g300n router .,[]
it came well-packaged .,"[('packaged', 'pos')]"
it 's a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically .,"[('device', 'pos'), ('looking', 'pos')]"
i give it a rating of 5 stars for looks .,"[('looks', 'pos')]"
external switch -lrb- auto mode -rrb- - it 's advertised as a router and wireless access point .,[]
"this is important , because not all routers can function as access points .",[]
"furthermore , one of the advertised features is an external switch that allows users to switch the device as a router , access point , or `` auto . ''",[]
"theoretically , `` auto '' is supposed to detect the present of a router or modem and then the nfinity g300n will function as an access point .",[]
"i do n't think i was able to get it to work because when i tried auto , the nfinity g300n never disabled it 's router functions .",[]
you can not have two devices on one network trying to assign ip addresses to other devices connected on the network .,[]
it does n't work .,[]
external switch -lrb- ap mode -rrb- - then i switched the router to the access point -lrb- ap -rrb- mode figuring that it would turn-off the nfiniti 's router function .,[]
that did n't work either .,[]
"i do n't think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end , you have to learn how to identify ip addresses , switch the router from from a dynamic to static ip address , and assign a static ip address that is compatible with your router or modem .","[('external switch', 'neg')]"
there 's no getting around it .,[]
"like i said , i have an average technical level and ultimately could not figure it out despite referring to the online user manual and various web-site suggestions .",[]
"in the end , i ended up calling the buffalo technologies technical support phone line .",[]
"setup software - for my application , i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless .","[('setup software', 'neg')]"
it really assumes a simple installation like plugging it in and using it as a router .,[]
"if that 's your type of installation , then the setup software might be the best thing since sliced bread .",[]
"technical support line - the buffalo technical support line on the other hand , was very helpful .","[('buffalo technical support line', 'pos')]"
"be prepared for a long wait -lrb- 30-45 minutes -rrb- , but the wait was worth it .","[('wait', 'neg')]"
the person i talked to was very knowledgeable and spoke english .,[]
i 'm guessing that he was actually located within the u.s. which i almost consider a bonus since so much technical support is overseas .,[]
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support 4 stars .,"[('technical support', 'pos')]"
if i only considered the software or internet user manual i would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -lrb- at best -rrb- .,"[('software', 'neg'), ('internet user manual', 'neg')]"
how to setup as an access point - the technical support representative walked me through the setup of the router .,[]
we did not use the software .,[]
"since i did n't find the software or user manual useful to help setup the nfinity g300n as an access point , i 'll try to summarize what we did in case you 're one of the unfortunate people like me who are relatively ignorant about manipulating ip addresses to setup an access point .",[]
1 .,[]
get important system information about your primary router or modem .,[]
windows 7 : click the `` start '' icon in the lower left corner -rrb- control panel -rrb- network and internet -rrb- network and sharing center -rrb- and then click `` see full map '' under the heading `` view your basic network information and setup connections . '',[]
move your pointer over the device icon labeled `` gateway '' .,[]
you 'll see a number that looks something like 192.168 .,[]
x.x. .,[]
this is an ip address .,[]
i learned that the first digits `` 192.168 '' are industry standard for private networks .,[]
"however the `` x. x '' are different between home networks and `` x '' may generally be one , two , or three digit numbers .",[]
2 .,[]
open a web browser .,[]
type the gateway ip address -lrb- 192.168 .,[]
x. x -rrb- into the browser address bar .,[]
a windows security window should open asking for a username and password that you previously setup to get into your primary router or modem setup software .,[]
it will depend on who makes your router or modem but there should be something like a `` status '' menu option .,[]
"in my case , i clicked on `` status '' and then on `` system data . ''",[]
i wonderful summary window appears that shows lan and internet ip information .,[]
the important number your looking for is the dhcp range .,[]
your router or modem has a lan ip address and then will assign addresses to other devices on your network in a given range which means the second `` x '' referenced above will range between two numbers .,[]
record this range because when you assign a static ip address to the buffalo nfinity it will need to be in this range .,[]
"on my first attempt , i assigned a static ip that was outside the range of my primary router so i had to go into my router setup and change my router 's range so my router could `` see '' the nfinity wireless access point .",[]
3 .,[]
reset the nfinity g300n using the reset button .,[]
this undid all the changes i made during previous attempts to set it up and restored factor defaults .,[]
"if you have n't messed with your router , you may not need to do this .",[]
4 .,[]
set the external nfinity g300n switch to ap mode -lrb- switch is in the `` off '' position -rrb- .,[]
5 .,[]
plug in the nfinity g300n power and connect it to the computer with an ethernet cable .,[]
make sure the ethernet cable is plugged into nfinity 's lan port and not the wan -lrb- blue -rrb- port .,[]
"this also means , the your computer is no longer connected to your network and is `` focused '' on setting up your nfinity g300n .",[]
6 .,[]
open another browser window .,[]
type the ip address for nfinity 's setup page .,[]
this might be the most useful information i got from the software disc .,[]
the default ip address from buffalo technologies was 192.168.11.1 for my device .,[]
type the default into the browser address window and the buffalo dd-wrt setup window should appear .,[]
my setup window was a gray and red color scheme .,[]
7 .,[]
"the first time you login , you might need to create a username and password .",[]
"under the `` wan connection type '' , click `` disable '' to disable `` automatic configuration - dhcp '' .",[]
"after changing the username and password , you should end up on the `` setup-basic '' screen .",[]
scroll down to `` network setup '' information and enter a local ip address for the nfinity .,[]
"remember , this is going to be 192.168 .",[]
x.x where x.x puts the nfinity in range of your primary router .,[]
the first `` x '' will be a number identical to that of your primary router or modem .,[]
the second `` x '' will be a number that is in the range of numbers that will be assigned by your primary router or modem .,[]
then enter your gateway ip address from you router or modem .,[]
the `` local dns ip '' address will be all zeros in most cases .,[]
scroll further down to `` network address server settings -lrb- dhcp -rrb- '' and make sure that the dhcp server is `` disabled . '',[]
scroll to the bottom and click `` apply settings . '',[]
8 .,[]
click on `` wireless '' heading on the buffalo setup homepage .,[]
then go to `` basic settings '' subheading and change wireless network name -lrb- ssid -rrb- to something you like .,[]
do n't make it too cute or interesting which might encourage hackers .,[]
make sure ssid broadcast is enabled .,[]
it should be .,[]
then click on `` wireless security '' subheading which is next to the `` basic settings '' subheading .,[]
"the buffalo tech rep had me change security mode to `` wpa personal '' , change wpa algorithms to `` aes '' , and change the wpa shared key -lrb- which is the password used to enter the network wirelessly .",[]
use a pretty difficult password .,[]
click `` apply settings . '',[]
9 .,[]
i unplugged my new nfinity g300n and moved it to a central location where i already had an ethernet jack installed .,[]
make sure that the nfinity wireless access point is connected to your network by a lan port and not the wan -lrb- blue -rrb- port .,[]
"summary - i 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the bufflo nfinity g300n is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .","[('setup', 'neg'), ('bufflo nfinity g300n', 'pos'), ('access point', 'pos'), ('range', 'pos')]"
and it 's sleek and sexy looking as well .,"[('sleek', 'pos'), ('looking', 'pos')]"
i can only wonder why buffalo technologies does n't post a video on their web site that shows exactly what their technical representative went over with me .,[]
it probably would have saved a phone call to their support line .,[]
i hope i accurately captured my notes from my call to buffalo technologies and that you find my notes helpful .,[]
i can not make an open-ended claims that my settings will ultimately work for you but hopefully my comments will help .,[]
"update jan 12 , 2012 the device has worked flawlessly for the past year .","[('worked', 'pos')]"
i bought this device to be a repeater bridge .,[]
"technically this is possible , but i instead just used wds to form an extended wireless network to a wired device .",[]
the unit came with the dd-wrt firmware dated from last august .,[]
i quickly updated this firmware to buffalo branded dd-wrt firmware dated this june .,[]
"it was all good , but i could not get the repeater bridge working .",[]
"i set it up as best i could with the directions , but it seems like this device is not able to do repeater bridge at this time .",[]
people have claimed that it is possible .,[]
"instead , i just installed the `` non-pro '' version of the firmware and setup wds mode .",[]
this worked because i needed to extend a wired network using the wireless network cards .,[]
"so , the wireless card on the buffalo are exclusively used to connect back to the wap ; wireless clients will not connect to the buffalo device .",[]
"after about a week , the wap and the buffalo remain linked , thus i can still access that remote machine connected to it .",[]
the device itself is pretty solid .,"[('device', 'pos')]"
i only had to reset the device one time to install the non pro software .,[]
i only give it 4 stars because the device came with really old dd-wrt software .,"[('dd-wrt software', 'neg')]"
"i was looking for a replacement for my tired old linksys wrt54g , of which i 'd used several for almost ten years .",[]
"on the recommendation of several friends and positive reviews , i picked up the wndr3700 .",[]
"unfortunately , when i purchased it , netgear had decided to push out a `` v2 '' model shortly before i purchased , which included a few hardware changes for the better , but the unit shipped with an atrocious firmware .",[]
"the system was nowhere near stable , and the code was in `` alpha '' stage at best .","[('system', 'pos')]"
"the router would close any open connection after about 2 minutes , meaning that telnet\/ssh and numerous games would suddenly disconnect .",[]
these speakers are incredibly amazing .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"before this i had the jbl on stage , which were also incredibly good .",[]
but i wanted something that i can play without having to plug into a power outlet and would work on rechargable batteries .,[]
i didnt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself -lrb- that is a pain -rrb- i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad i purchased these speakers .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
most of the reviews about the sound quality is true .,[]
"the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!","[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos'), ('bass', 'pos')]"
although the bass im getting out of these speakers was unexpected .,[]
"without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage , and are truly portable -lrb- can be played without a power outlet , i love that feature -rrb- .","[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound quality', 'pos'), ('portable', 'pos')]"
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight .,"[('remote', 'neg')]"
its not a big deal for me .,[]
the main thing i was looking for was sound quality !,[]
"i read all the reviews herein , and saw all the concerns .",[]
"first , i was looking for an iphone dock and fm tuner , not necessarily an alarm clock - as its for the office .",[]
"i must say : - it works with iphone4 , even with thin case on it .",[]
just push it into the slot - it charges the iphone4 .,[]
"- it allows incoming calls to interrupt the music , and you can answer the call without having to undock it .",[]
- it allows incoming email and txt messages to be read and responded to w\/o undocking it - essentially you can do all iphone apps while its docked .,[]
- sound quality is good .,"[('sound quality', 'pos')]"

my only recommendation - include a remote ... buy this !,[]
"i purchased this phone set for work , thinking that inexpensive replacement phones would ease the pain of things being spilled on them or dropped .",[]

other complaints : you ca n't put line 1 on hold and answer line 2 with the same handset without a `` conference call '' beginning .,[]
the incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers -lrb- it was so bad i had my hearing tested because i thought something was wrong with me .,"[('volume', 'neg')]"

these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
these serve as my primary speakers in my living room -lrb- about 14x22 -rrb- .,[]
"they sit on stands about 8 '' high , and are pretty close to being in the corners on one of the long walls .",[]
"i am sure that if i had spent more and gone with bigger , floor-standing units from klipsch , i would be even more impressed , but frankly , these get the job done and do n't seem to break a sweat .",[]
"most of our listening is at modest volumes , but i have turned them up on some demanding tracks and they do n't flinch .",[]
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers .,"[('bass', 'pos')]"
"my only wish would be that these would 've been made in the usa rather than china , but at least the company is still mostly based here .",[]
"i tried to use these with my laptop -lrb- dell inspiron 1720 -rrb- but could n't get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned , no matter how far i moved them from the computer or where i plugged them in .","[('noise', 'neg')]"
"i took them to a different room and tested them with my mp3 player , where they worked fine and sounded pretty good .","[('worked', 'pos'), ('sounded', 'pos')]"
"so -- before ordering , consider what you will use them for .",[]
this little speaker has dynamite sound !!,"[('speaker', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
i should have ordered two .,[]
"my only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough .","[('cord', 'neg')]"
i use it for my tablet .,[]
these stands are about 3 feet high with my onkyo surrounds attached .,[]
"excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .","[('quality', 'pos'), ('stands', 'pos')]"
wire runs through the body of the stand - giving it a very clean look .,"[('look', 'pos')]"
i used the double sided tape along the base for mine and it seems to be pretty secure .,[]
"i 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .","[('stands', 'pos'), ('wire', 'pos')]"
"i 'm very happy with these , i 'll probably buy 2 more for the front channels .","[('front channels', 'pos')]"
one thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .,"[('stands', 'neg'), ('speakers', 'neg')]"
so be mindful of your seating height before purchasing this .,[]
pros : - big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - under $ 200 - decent sounding speakers cons : volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('volume adjustment', 'neg')]"
"i got mine quick , everything works fine , botta boom botta bing .",[]
i do wish they came with mounting screws for the speakers .,[]
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short .,"[('dsub cord', 'neg')]"
"that and for the center speaker , when i mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall .","[('heavy', 'neg')]"
"i 'm trying to find some bigger screws to get it flush , but the screws attach at the bottom so there 's no support for the top of the speaker which hangs .",[]

"i 'm a college kid , recreational audiophile and bass fanatic , studying engineering .",[]

"i 'm running a pair of these off an h\/k avr240 , combined with a jbl ec35 center , a jbl s120pii 400w sub , and two sets of e30 surrounds .",[]
i 'm big on trying anything before i buy it .,[]
i was able to listen to these and the e80s -lrb- the dual 6 '' floorstandings -rrb- at a local audio store before they were discontinued .,[]
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
"with the jbls at a fraction of the price here on amazon , it was no question .",[]
the only issue was what model to get ... i heard very little difference in qualtiy between the e60s and e80s .,[]
"the dual 6 '' put out a bit lower frequencies , but the difference was so small that i would n't be able to notice without the speakers side by side .",[]
"living in a small college apartment the e90s and e100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what i needed .","[('e90s', 'pos'), ('e100s', 'pos')]"
i deceided on these over the e60s with the hopes that a single 8 '' would draw less from my amp than the dual 6 '' for a bit less money .,[]

logitech have a way of seeing what is needed in any given area and bringing it to fruition .,[]

"i have owned my 5500s for a couple of years now and still love them , at least in general .",[]
for the price there 's nothing better .,"[('price', 'pos')]"
i especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .,"[('controller', 'pos'), ('volume knob', 'pos'), ('selector buttons', 'pos')]"
i 've tried to find a full-size receiver with something comparable but there 's nothing .,[]
the 5500 is effectively a ` receiver ' in that it has multiple inputs and full dolby and dts processing -lrb- just no radio : - -rrb- the one real problem i 've had was something that i did n't even notice until months after i 'd purchased it .,[]
when i mute the optical input the sub-woofer is not muted ?!,[]
"i have my tv 's tuner connected to the optical and my htpc connected to the coax , and i mostly use the computer to watch recordings .",[]
"so it was only on the rare occasion that i was watching a live broadcast \* and \* hit mute during a commercial \* and \* that the commercial had a 5.1 soundtrack -lrb- with sub-woofer sounds , i.e. , the '' .1 '' part -rrb- that i realized there was something wrong .",[]
i would be interested to know if any other 5500 owners have the same problem as logitech tech support said it was an unknown problem .,[]
they offered to replace my controller but -- important to note -- they were unwilling to cross-ship it .,"[('cross-ship', 'neg')]"
so i would have had to go without surround sound while waiting\/trusting them to send me a replacement asap .,[]
it just was n't worth it and so i 've had to live with the problem -lrb- infrequent as it is -rrb- .,[]
this is not exactlly what i expected but i was plesentlly surprised .,[]
the sound quality is really good .,"[('sound quality', 'pos')]"
the size is small .,"[('size', 'pos')]"
the way i have to put in my i-pod was a little tricky but when it was done the speakers sound really good .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
ive only had it a few days so i cant say anymore than that .,[]
i had the klipsh promedia speakers before the corsair 2500 also and i can tell you the klipsh does not compare at all to the corsair .,[]
the klipsh subwoofer is laughable .,"[('klipsh subwoofer', 'neg')]"
the satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .,"[('satellites', 'pos'), ('corsair', 'pos')]"
the subwoofer of the corsair is miles ahead of the klipsh .,[]
you pay for what you get .,[]
i have sb titanium fatility pro sound card .,[]
do not purchase ... this item will not hold a charge and spontaneously deletes the downloads ... spend the $ $ for the ipod .,[]
"also , amamzon will not refund me , does n't have a phone number for the manufacturer or any other contact info for visul land .",[]
i was n't quite sure what to make of this speaker when it arrived .,[]
"i have no experience with ` speaker bars ' as my home theater system consists of traditional front speakers , center channel , and four rear speakers .",[]
the speaker arived in excellent condition .,"[('speaker', 'pos'), ('condition', 'pos')]"
the styrofoam inserts kept everything secure and undamaged .,[]
"enclosed were the instructions , a wall mounting bracket , and a bracket for placing the speaker on a shelf .",[]
"my inital thought was `` damn , this thing is a beast '' .",[]
i could probably battle orcs in the front yard with this speaker bar .,[]
the build quality is top notch .,"[('quality', 'pos')]"
"very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .","[('joints', 'pos'), ('finish', 'pos'), ('speaker wire hook-ups', 'pos')]"
i chose to place the speaker on my home theater stand on the top shelf directly in front of the tv .,[]
my tv is a 46 '' sony bravia lcd with a sony 7.1 home theater system .,[]
to test the speaker bar i used my new bluray disc of transformers 2 .,[]
initially the sound was low and sounded `` off '' .,"[('sound', 'neg')]"
then i remembered to recalibrate the sony audio since i added different speakers .,[]
after a quick calibration i fired up transformers 2 .,[]
my initial reaction was `` wow '' .,[]
the front sound comes directly from the front of the tv as sound should .,[]
i did n't realize that having front speakers off to the sides of the tv would make so much difference .,[]
"the sound was crisp , clear , and no distortion .","[('sound', 'pos')]"
i cranked the audio up to level 40 during the best decepticon battle .,[]
the speaker bar response was spot-on .,"[('speaker bar', 'pos')]"
the sounds were as the movie directors intended .,"[('sounds', 'pos')]"
i did n't get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers .,"[('sounds', 'pos')]"
i was able to enjoy the transformers even more than my initial viewing .,[]
for a second test i tuned into a show on sciencehd .,[]
"again , the sounds were spot-on and projected from where they should , the front of the tv .","[('sounds', 'pos')]"
very nice since this was a normal cable hd program .,[]
i 'm quite happy with my new speaker bar .,"[('speaker bar', 'pos')]"
i 'm kicking myself for not embracing this technology earlier .,[]
"for those of you looking for excellent sound reproduction , expecially during a raging decepticon battle , look no further .","[('sound reproduction', 'pos')]"
this pinnacle speaker bar is well worth the money .,"[('pinnacle speaker bar', 'pos')]"
"it also has a 10 year warranty , which is just icing on the cake .","[('warranty', 'pos')]"

save you 're money and keep shopping .,[]
over for the price this is a good unit .,"[('price', 'pos'), ('unit', 'pos')]"
"sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .","[('sound quality', 'pos'), ('bass quality', 'pos')]"
build quality is great .,"[('quality', 'pos')]"
the remote control and reciever not so good .,"[('remote control', 'neg'), ('reciever', 'neg')]"
the buttons are confusing and super small .,"[('buttons', 'neg')]"
when left on for 8 + hours you get a unusual humm that does n't go away till cooled off .,[]
still for the price you ca n't find better for the cost .,"[('price', 'pos')]"
i 'm part of the group that has had no luck with these .,[]
"they worked in the beginning ... then something fried inside the sub ... returned them , got new ones ... same thing happened ... now they are unuseable .",[]
they start to go when you hear the light crackling ... then it moves into the bass distortion mode ... now they just hum loudly with intermitent loud crackling .,[]
"i 'm now shopping for new speaker and when i saw that they were still available i just wanted to see what other folks were saying about them ... wow , i 'm not alone !",[]
"they look cool but they have a quality issue for sure ... hit or miss i guess , a gamble for sure !","[('look', 'pos'), ('quality issue', 'neg')]"
"this audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .","[('audio bar', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
it only bother 's me when i want the laptop in my lap so i need the screen down a little but this device pulls it way back down .,[]
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
"if anything sometimes i just lay it behind my laptop when it 's on the table or you could just have it laying next to you , like on the couch or something .",[]
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now !,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
i purchased 4 pairs of theese speakers and installed them in my family room -lrb- i only used 7 -rrb- for a surround sound system .,[]
they were easy to install and ended up using 300 feet of cable .,"[('install', 'pos')]"
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .,"[('price', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
billy joel was n't kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('cheep', 'pos')]"
the frist thing i did was put ice age in the blueray player and the thx sound check was awesom .,[]
my wife who really could care less about thees things was impressed i do n't think i will ever go to the movie theater again .,[]
i highly recomend theese speakers .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"as always , super quick shipping by amazon , items arrived in great shape .","[('shipping', 'pos'), ('shape', 'pos')]"

i have no problem at all recommending these stands .,"[('stands', 'pos')]"
i 'm a late user to this type of entertainment ... i still use cd 's but was recently given an ipod and do n't know how i lived without it for so long !,[]
my wife and i travel and i thought i might be able to find a portable speaker system so that we could enjoy our music when away from home .,[]
this is my second purchase of this type of speaker and as with the first ... this is n't what you want !,[]
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca n't hear a thing .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
i 'm sure it would and can be useful in a different setting ; one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper .,"[('setting', 'pos')]"
i plan on keeping this unit for those times when using my ear buds is n't the best of ideas but this unit would n't fit my need say in a hotel room when i 'm trying to set the mood with a little music .,[]
good quality for a small portable speaker .,"[('quality', 'pos'), ('portable', 'pos'), ('speaker', 'pos')]"
convenience because it works through the usb port .,"[('usb port', 'pos')]"
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder .,"[('volumn', 'neg')]"
"after seeing and hearing the sound of the i-tour pop speaker , i was sold .","[('sound', 'pos')]"
so much so that i 've already ordered 5 of the speakers for all the young adult children in our family for christmas .,[]
"i 've been surprised at how many uses i 've found for it , i 've used it with my laptop in the kitchen , and attached to my iphone 4 , i 've used it in the car , put it on the ledge in the kitchen above the sink and watched movies while doing the dishes , and carried it from room to room while i 've listened to pandora .",[]
its tiny and has really decent sound for something so small .,"[('tiny', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
the rechargeable battery is a great feature .,"[('battery', 'pos'), ('feature', 'pos')]"
very good value for the money .,"[('value', 'pos')]"
i am a very pleased customer .,[]
i love this little speaker .,"[('speaker', 'pos')]"
i had purchased a black one some time ago that i was also crazy about so i bought this to have with my other devices .,[]
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('priced', 'pos')]"
"the speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -lrb- perhaps even better than expected -rrb- .","[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos'), ('size', 'pos'), ('range', 'pos')]"
"however , i am still a little disappointed when you come down to the overall feeling i get from the purchase .",[]
"to start with , i bought these for my wife to use with her ipod .",[]
there are no incompatibility problems and they work fine .,"[('work', 'pos')]"
"i do find the lack of a way to turn them off , short of unplugging them a bit of a shortcoming .",[]
"the range of response seems a little limited to me -lrb- changing the eq setting on the ipod produces a definite change in the sound , but i would expect a little more richness in the changes -rrb- .","[('range of response', 'neg')]"
"the size is a bit more than i expected from bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .","[('size', 'neg'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
"lastly , i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got -lrb- unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do n't know of -rrb- .","[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"bottom line , i have a better set of speakers , in the creative labs i-trigue 2200 2.0 speakers , on my computer -lrb- at least to my ears -rrb- , for less than half the cost .","[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"so think hard and shop around before you jump on the bose name , or better yet , if you can , try them out first .",[]
"this portable speaker is easy to use , powerful enough for everyday use , and available at a pretty decent price .","[('speaker', 'pos'), ('use', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
it 's been working continuously as background music in my office for the past year without a hitch .,[]
the battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -lrb- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -rrb- .,"[('battery', 'pos'), ('sound quality', 'pos')]"
i recommend it over its more expensive counterparts .,[]
awesome sound system .,"[('sound system', 'pos')]"
"had a jvc system that was 6 years old and i thought it was good , but the onkyo sound is amazing !","[('onkyo sound', 'pos')]"
"it was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand , even for an old guy like me .","[('install', 'pos'), ('components and directions', 'pos')]"
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin .,"[('speaker wire', 'neg')]"
i would think that a quality system like this would have come with at least 18 or 16 guage wire .,[]
i bought this item along with a couple of other external speakers in an effort to find a good set to use in my elderly car -lrb- speaker system died -rrb- .,[]
"this set is not my preferred to use in my car -lrb- i use the jbl on tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -rrb- , but i was very impressed with the phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .","[('sound', 'pos'), ('speaker', 'pos'), ('phillip speaker sound', 'pos')]"
"for the price , the sound is great and their portability -lrb- pack down to a large egg-shape -rrb- is quite good .","[('price', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos'), ('portability', 'pos')]"
you ca n't go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package !,"[('sound', 'pos')]"

"however , the bose station did not fill the 3 room basement as we wanted so i started searching new speakers .",[]
"the thought of buying 2 new sets of floor speakers for 300-500 $ a pair just did not make sense , plus if we flood again would i need to put them up on blocks etc. .",[]
i have yet to here bookshelf speakers i like thus i turned to wireless options and found sonos .,[]

"i turned them up loud , acdc thunderstruck , wow , we rocked out , no distortion , had to back them down , lol .",[]
"the s5 can be run solo by itself , acts as both left and right in one room , or you can `` pair '' 2 s5 units and have one be left and one right as i did in a very large room .",[]
"the only connection the s5 units require is an electrical outlet , rest is wireless unless you need to connect it to a router -lrb- no bridge -rrb- or you have something to input via jack in back -lrb- ipod -rrb- .",[]
"remember , the music comes from any online source you can think of and your music libraries on your home network -lrb- i tunes , windows media player etc. -rrb- .",[]
"at this point , someone geekier than me is probably thinking of my many mistakes , omissions and lay speak but i do n't care , i do n't need your corrections , just move on .",[]
the controller can be a sonos one or an app for your iphone or a controller downloaded to your pc or mac .,[]
"i chose all 3 so i can control it anywhere , anytime , but by far the iphone app is just stupid fun and cool .",[]
you can control everything you need to while sitting anywhere in your home as long as you have your home wifi .,[]
"you can control each s5 player seperately , what music and what volume , tone , pause etc , all independent of other players !",[]
you understand ?,[]
"if you have 6 of the players around your home you can play 6 different sources of music , at 6 different volumes , pause some or all , and this is all done from your iphone !",[]
"and you can have multiple controllers -lrb- 12 i think -rrb- , so my wife and i can fight over the volume settings while we are in different areas of the house , is hilarious .",[]
"well enough for this review , i just ordered the sonos 90 unit to connect my home stereo system into the sonos system , this unit utilizes your existing amp -lrb- receiver -rrb- and speakers and makes another zone player out of them , too cool .",[]

"the volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .","[('volume', 'pos'), ('vibration', 'neg'), ('distortion', 'neg')]"
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my 2nd generation ipod nano .,"[('incompatibility', 'neg')]"
"a new dock was added i see , but the ipod can not be played with the dock unless i hold down the top .",[]
"it works fine without the dock , but it 's shaky and unstable .","[('works', 'pos')]"
"so besides the annoyances , this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid .","[('speaker', 'pos')]"
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more .,"[('cost', 'pos')]"
the sound quality is very exceptable .,"[('sound quality', 'pos')]"
"the only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .","[('speakers', 'neg'), ('tone side', 'neg')]"
"all in all , could n't be more happy with the purchase .",[]
easy set up and the picture was crystal clear .,"[('set up', 'pos'), ('picture', 'pos')]"
i use it for the xbox as well as my computer and i cried with joy .,[]
ok enough said just buy it .,[]
love this speaker .,"[('speaker', 'pos')]"
sounds awesome .,"[('sounds', 'pos')]"
works super easy .,"[('works', 'pos')]"
looks great .,"[('looks', 'pos')]"
seems to be durable enough but i 've only had it a few weeks so we 'll see .,[]
my only complaint is like others here ... it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it 's really annoying when it does because it does it so often .,"[('disconnects', 'neg')]"
"if it did n't do that , it would be perfect .",[]
"because of that though , i am tempted to send it back .",[]
this little item blew my sock off when i heard the sound of it .,[]
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs .,"[('highs', 'pos')]"
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand .,"[('sounds', 'pos')]"
i would recomend this unit to anyone .,[]
i have found this little device to be quite fun to use .,"[('device', 'pos'), ('use', 'pos')]"
the range seems quite good even through walls .,"[('range', 'pos')]"
i mainly use it with my apple ipad and it really sounds quite good for it diminutive size .,"[('sounds', 'pos'), ('size', 'pos')]"
"i find the issue with it connecting to be a little problematic , but it connects eventually .",[]
not bad overall .,[]
"these are great if you want radio , but your radio is too far away to hear and you do n't want to blast it .",[]
"the range is great , i can list to my radio anywhere in the house .","[('range', 'pos')]"
i just move my speaker to whatever room i 'm cleaning or whatever room i want to listen to the music at .,[]
"if you are hosting a party and want music to play throughout your house , this would be a great option as well .",[]
all you need is an outlet and you are good to go !,[]
i 'm a big fan of lapdesks for my netbook and notebook pcs .,[]
i use them to protect my legs from the heat output as well as for comfort .,[]
"when logitech introduced their new line of lapdesks with built-in external speakers for portable computers , i was so excited !",[]
"while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers , the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers , making it harder to hear some audio .","[('volume', 'neg')]"
logitech 's n550 speaker lapdesk wins in the area of comfort .,"[('n550 speaker lapdesk', 'pos')]"
the padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .,"[('underside', 'pos'), ('typing experience', 'pos')]"
the speakers themselves sound really good .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
powering it from the laptop or netbook 's usb port keeps your computing experience truly portable as you do n't need to plug in to an external power source .,[]
"even better , you do n't have to worry about constantly replacing batteries .","[('batteries', 'pos')]"
"the right side of the lapdesk has three convenienctly placed volume control buttons : mute , volume up , and volume down .",[]
installing the lapdesk on both windows xp and windows vista computers was a snap - the drivers installed automatically as soon as the device was plugged in with no need for a software install or a reboot .,[]
one thing i missed was an area for an external mouse .,[]
i almost always use one with both my netbook and my laptop .,[]
"while the netbook is small enough to leave room for an external mouse , there really is n't enough room for it with my laptop , which is 14 '' .",[]
"which brings me to the next point : this is advertised as being for small laptops and netbooks that are 14 '' and under in size , and that is certainly true .",[]
"all in all , this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers .","[('option', 'pos')]"
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i 've ever owned .,"[('devices', 'pos')]"
this is nice enough that it will go with any deluxe home configuration .,[]
"the speakers are pretty small , so they wo n't take up a lot of space , but they play as loud as you want them to , and they have great quality .","[('speakers', 'pos'), ('small', 'pos'), ('quality', 'pos')]"
i paired this very easily to two different android phones .,"[('paired', 'pos')]"
"for inputs , you can either use bluetooth or a standard audio jack .",[]
it also has a headphone out .,[]
this means that the device is discoverable .,[]
"\* if the light blinks blue slowly , then you did n't press the bluetooth button long enough \* turn on bluetooth on your android \* scan for devices on your android \* on your android , the device name will be , `` creative t12 wireless '' \* choose `` pair with this device '' on your android .",[]
i never needed a password .,[]
"\* it will automatically pair , and now you can play music .",[]
this product is amazing !!!,"[('product', 'pos')]"
the sound this slim design puts out !!,"[('sound', 'pos'), ('design', 'pos')]"
i could n't beleive what i purchased after i received the item .,[]
very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .,"[('quality item', 'neg'), ('speaker', 'neg'), ('sound', 'neg')]"
do n't purchase it .,[]
this product was as advertised and fulfilled my expectations .,[]
i recommend this product and would buy it again if needed .,[]
again this product is recommended by this reviewer .,[]
"it 's a fun little gadget , do n't expect high definition sound .","[('definition sound', 'neg')]"
i had read about the soundbugs on various websites in the past ; i eventually bought it out of curiosity .,[]
"the best use that i found so far for the soundbug , is putting it on the glass of the sliding balcony door to listen to the music outside , while keeping the door shut -lrb- because of the a\/c , for example -rrb- .",[]
another use is to connect it to a portable mp3 player ...,[]
i purchased these for my desk at work .,[]
they sound really good just as the reviews say .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
a little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .,"[('bass', 'pos'), ('mids', 'neg')]"
they are n't quite as loud as some of the reviews seem to imply but that could be because of the acoutics of the area they are in .,[]
the switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the `` pulse '' is n't really all that but that is irrelevant to me .,"[('switch', 'neg')]"
they do look cool in the dark though .,"[('look', 'neg')]"
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .,"[('computer speakers', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price .,"[('speakers', 'neg'), ('preform', 'neg')]"
bought the klipsch 2.1 and found them clearly superior to these .,[]
"if you are concerned about looks , get these .","[('looks', 'pos')]"
"if you want good sound , stay away !!!","[('sound', 'neg')]"
best ht upgrade i 've made in over 2 years .,"[('ht upgrade', 'pos')]"
i am a cheapskate when it comes to spending .,[]
"i always obsess about researching others reviews before i pull the trigger , especially when it comes to electronics or books .",[]
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker .,"[('quality', 'neg')]"
"now , i am not all that technical when it comes to anything , i have just learned from the experience -lrb- and skills , technical know-how , etc. -rrb- of others , but my ears do not lie .",[]
"i recently purchased some sennheiser headphones , which have done wonders for audio when on the bus to and from work .",[]
"well , this speaker does the same wonders for my low-end ht setup .","[('speaker', 'pos')]"
dialogue is very noticeably clearer .,"[('dialogue', 'pos')]"
sound effects really sound more authentic .,"[('sound effects', 'pos')]"
"while watching good will hunting yesterday , there was a scene where whathisface starts up his birthday gift car , and i thought , yes , that does sound like a car just started in my family room !",[]
"i also noticed that in general volume levels can be much lower and the dialogue will still be understandable , even when i had a room air conditioner and another fan blowing at max in the same room .",[]
"well , stop reading my review and pull the trigger , you will have no regrets like me and others !",[]
"well , except for the fact that i bus to work\/home , so when it arrived at my work , i was carrying a 25 lb .",[]
"the box was the size of a large boombox , and i would occasionally peer about me on the way home , partially wondering when i was going to get jacked for the speaker !",[]
": -rrb- p.s. btw , the robbery never occurred , i got home safe and sound ...",[]
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .,"[('tone', 'neg'), ('speakers', 'neg')]"
the second set is working just fine .,"[('working', 'pos')]"
"you can fill a small room with sound pretty good , but do n't think it rivals a home theater system .","[('sound', 'pos')]"
music sounds great but having surround sound in game is nice and a big difference from headphones .,"[('surround sound', 'pos')]"
"they are currently marked down to $ 70 , that is the lowest i have seen them and definitely worth it .",[]
these speakers are a greatg value i use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('value', 'pos')]"
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub .,"[('used', 'pos')]"
you will not be dissapointed .,[]
in addition the price point is spectacular .,"[('price point', 'pos')]"
"i read an earlier review that these speakers have to be protected from weather somewhat when used outdoors , so i thought they 'd make fine speakers for the bathroom , and i was right .",[]
i 'm to lazy to register so i used the kid 's review form .,[]
so let 's get started .,[]
these are the only computer speakers i 've ever bought so i have no comparison to anything else .,"[('computer speakers', 'pos')]"
"the speakers actually sound like speakers , average speakers though .",[]
"the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down , but it 's all right because these are computer speakers .","[('subwoofer', 'neg')]"
"these are more suitable for hip hop or rock , the dialogue sounds unnatural and piano music sounds like midi -lrb- lol -rrb- .",[]
"some may not like the horn tweeters , as they tend to sound too hot .","[('horn tweeters', 'neg')]"
i usually avoid horns but i do n't hear anything overly extreme .,"[('horns', 'neg')]"
this system is very powerful .,"[('system', 'pos')]"
it played clean up to the highest levels -lrb- except for the subwoofer which had port noise -rrb- .,[]
it effortlessly filled by medium-sized room with sound .,[]
"do n't be mislead by the thx logo on it , though .",[]
the requirements for computer speakers are n't as strict as the ones for theater equipment .,[]
"in other words , you 're not going to watch star wars on this thing .",[]
so it all comes together .,[]
"this is a great 3-piece speaker system for a computer , and it 's worth every penny .","[('speaker system', 'pos')]"
audiophiles though would n't bother with such mediocre equipment -lrb- so bug off -rrb- and go listen to their music somewhere else .,[]
"i broke this in for more than 400 hours , not continuously or course .",[]
this is the best sound system i have ever heard .,"[('sound system', 'pos')]"
it beats my z 680 which i accidently destroyed by a water spill .,[]
the woofer is much larger .,"[('woofer', 'pos')]"
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
but it is better .,[]
i would recommend this to anyone looking for the type of surround sound found in the theaters .,[]
during games it will shake your seat bottom and the floor and maybe even the neighbors floor if they live too close .,[]
"if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs , i would give a 2.5 stars , but i 'm giving 4 because i think they do the job that most people want them for .","[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"what i do n't like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor .","[('tonal qualities', 'neg')]"
i have to make equalizer adjustments for every different song to make it sound right .,[]
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built-in speaker crossovers .,"[('speaker crossovers', 'neg')]"
you can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .,"[('mid-range', 'neg'), ('bass', 'neg')]"
"however , once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music , viola , the audio is great -lrb- well , this is relative - great for a computer speaker -rrb- .","[('computer speaker', 'pos')]"
pros : - great sound for a $ 100 speaker at mid to higher levels .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i 've owned .,"[('computer speakers', 'pos')]"
- input and headphone on right jack is super handy .,"[('input', 'pos'), ('headphone', 'pos')]"
- construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .,"[('components', 'neg')]"
"- power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .","[('power', 'pos'), ('volume', 'pos'), ('bass controls', 'pos'), ('speaker', 'pos')]"
"- if you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -lrb- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers i 've heard -rrb- .","[('computer speaker', 'pos'), ('bass', 'pos')]"
cons : - i think the satellites look ugly .,"[('satellites', 'neg')]"
the metal grills remind me of '80s boom boxes .,[]
"also , certifications do n't impress me , so i 'd really rather not be reminded every time that i look at the speaker that i probably paid an extra % 15 just for logitech to have these thx certified .",[]
- ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up .,"[('sub woofer', 'neg')]"
"this is a preference , but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels , i 'd be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less ... redolent of a teenager 's car system .","[('speakers', 'pos')]"
- games and video can sound very tinny if you do n't do some adjustments on the software end when you switch from music .,[]
"while these speakers are capable of sounding good , i have to do more adjustments every time i change media type to keep it from sounding bad .","[('speakers', 'pos'), ('adjustments', 'neg')]"
- fixed speaker cable -- why do this ?,"[('speaker cable', 'neg')]"
to increase the likelihood that we have to buy new speakers in a few years ?,[]
- sub woofer is large .,"[('sub woofer', 'pos')]"
"for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing -lrb- very good for a computer speaker -rrb- , this is probably necessary .","[('computer speaker', 'pos')]"
i just do n't want this .,[]
conclusion : i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them .,"[('speakers', 'neg')]"
i decided to give them a chance and i 've gotten a little more used to them .,[]
"i 'm still very frustrated with some of the properties , but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card 's control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games , the sound is much more acceptable .","[('properties', 'neg')]"
i really just want quality sound for listening to my music at moderate levels while i 'm doing work on my computer and these speakers really do n't shine until you start to crank them .,[]
i tried to adjust my rating a bit higher assuming that many people probably want exactly what these do -lrb- and i 'm happy i do n't live in an apartment next to you -rrb- .,[]
i love this speakers .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
sound quality and base is amazing .,"[('sound quality', 'pos'), ('base', 'pos')]"
this tiny speakers produce really big sound .,"[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
i would strongly recommend this product !,"[('product', 'pos')]"
"the speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .","[('speakers', 'neg'), ('volume', 'neg')]"
this is proof that good things come in small packages .,[]
"this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp3 players , including sansas and ipods .","[('size', 'pos'), ('speaker system', 'pos'), ('sounds', 'pos')]"
i set it up in my living room and the sound was superb .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
"it played my sandisk e260 beautifully , and then we jacked in my son 's ipod 30 gig and it played it perfectly as well .",[]
this is a superb system and highly recommended .,"[('system', 'pos')]"
"it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it , but as it turns out , so much the better .","[('smaller', 'pos')]"
a great system at an incredible price .,"[('system', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
"i 'm not easily impressed by electronics , tending to be a little conservative , but this product really deserves five stars .","[('product', 'pos')]"
operates off household current as well as batteries .,[]
"if you do n't have the smaller size sandisk mp3 -lrb- mine is bigger than the series the dock is designed for -rrb- , the player does not fit in the dock , but it jacked into the audio input with a cord that is included .",[]
"a small cosmetic issue , but good to know .",[]
"however , because this dock plays about any mp3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .","[('quality', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
"these are good looking , durable speaker stands .","[('looking', 'pos'), ('speaker stands', 'pos')]"
i have n't even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over .,"[('carpet tacks', 'neg')]"
i bought them along with one of the specified speakers suggested by harmon .,[]
"they are seamless when looking at them straight on , but at side and 3\/4 views -lrb- pictures that were not available on line -rrb- the rear of the speaker is visible .",[]
overall they are great stands and look good .,"[('stands', 'pos'), ('look', 'pos')]"
assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are n't that great .,"[('drawings', 'neg')]"
go to harmon on line to see better instructions if needed .,[]
"i have two , the xtrememac luna voyager and this ihome ip16gxc .",[]
both provide a docking port for the ipod\/iphone on the top panel .,[]
both then sync with the device so as to display the time .,[]
"the xtrememac , which is just a few dollars less expensive than the ihome model , has a blue florescent digit display for the clock while the ihome has a backlit lcd display .",[]
"while the xtrememac looks cooler , the ihome is actually more legible from a distance and easier to read at a glance .",[]
"both , at the touch of a button , start playing music from the content of the idevice .",[]
the idevice is then accessed to change songs .,[]
volume is adjusted from the ihome .,[]
"both units have an alarm clock capability , with the ipod\/iphone utilized for the musical accompaniment .",[]
"the big difference in the two units , beyond their appearance , is in sound quality .",[]
"both units are small , with similarly small speakers .","[('units', 'pos'), ('speakers', 'pos')]"
"the ihome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .","[('stereo separation', 'pos'), ('bass level', 'pos')]"
"when i first listened to the xtrememac , i thought there was only a single speaker .",[]
the ihome 's stereo reproduction is clearly superior .,"[('stereo reproduction', 'pos')]"
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well .,"[('clarity', 'pos')]"
"the speakers of the xtrememac are built into the unit , out of harm 's way , and this is advantageous in a dusty environment or one in which small children might poke and prod at the unit .",[]
"on the ihome , the speaker domes are out in the open at the end of the unit .",[]
they can be easily damaged if poked .,[]
"obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .","[('design', 'pos'), ('sound quality', 'pos')]"
the ihome has a watch-type battery to hold time if the power goes out .,[]
it takes four aa batteries if portability is desired away from an ac line while still using the built in speakers and amplifier .,[]
"i tested it with the original iphone , the iphone3gs , and the iphone4 -lrb- att -rrb- and had no problems with any of these sources .",[]
"well , a friend of mine 's got the tower without the bluetooth feature , and it was really awesome so for a long time i was willing to buy a tower from this particular brand , 30 extra dolars for the bluetooth feature isnt bad at all .",[]
"i got it today , it works great , great sound for its size and price , i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do n't complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone , i highly recommend this tower .","[('works', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos'), ('size', 'pos'), ('price', 'pos')]"
"first of all , i disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .","[('bass', 'neg'), ('system', 'neg')]"
i also disagree that this system sounds like a boombox .,[]
it sounds great !,[]
"i chose this system in particular because it 's thx certified , so i knew it was unlikely that they 'd sound disappointingly bad .",[]
"they sound wonderful , in my opinion , and i have n't even touched any equalizers .","[('sound', 'pos')]"
i got them for my girlfriend so she would n't be stuck with 2w laptop speakers anymore .,[]
i 'm breaking them in with some trance at a moderate volume right now .,[]
"mid-range is n't the best , but it 's certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend $ 300 + on computer speakers .","[('mid-range', 'neg')]"
"the highs and lows sound great and personally i think the bass is at a perfect level -lrb- at 50 % -rrb- , definitely not boomy .","[('highs', 'pos'), ('lows', 'pos'), ('bass', 'pos')]"
"in fact , it beats my -lrb- albeit 11 year old -rrb- altec lansing ada885 system 's subwoofer -lrb- system originally $ 300 -rrb- .",[]
"bottom line is for the price , these things sound great and have tons of good bass .","[('price', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos'), ('bass', 'pos')]"
highly recommend .,[]
"definitely worth spending the extra money over a cheaper $ 60 system ... grab these instead , you 'll be glad you did .",[]
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"what it really is , is a pouch with speaker - the zippers open up a little bucket for your sunglasses and your cell phone inside .",[]
the waterproof feature is also true because it is still working after 2 hours in drizzle .,[]
the mount is easy to use ... it 's just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars .,"[('mount', 'pos'), ('use', 'pos')]"
i have a bike light so i had to remove it to cater enough space to put this speaker on .,[]
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that 's ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone .,"[('bigger', 'neg')]"
"i believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your desktop computer or laptop , i try this at bestbuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when i got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , i have a mac and i wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible pci card , i found a great plug-in for mac i-tunes , srs iwow , after installing the demo i was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .","[('speakers', 'pos'), ('sound', 'pos')]"
i was super excited to receive this little speaker .,[]
"i got this item for the sole reason to use on my ipad since the built-in speaker on that device is horribly low , even in quiet rooms !",[]
i plugged this baby in my ipod and had 5 people in the living room speak at the same time to see if this thing can overpower that noise .,[]
man was i surprised !,[]
this thing drowned all five people out !,[]
my brother and i were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is .,"[('loud', 'pos')]"
"after my first test run with it , my brother took my smartphone , logged into my amazon account , and bought one for himself .",[]
yes he asked first lol .,[]
i am planning on posting a video to show how loud this thing is .,[]
"i deducted a star because , when i put my ipod and ipad on full volume , the speaker 's bass began to completely ruin the sound .","[('bass', 'neg')]"
it sounded like an busted up speaker and the lyrics were muffled .,[]
that kind of annoyed me ... a lot .,[]
"but to remedy this , all i did was set my ipod and ipad to either treble reducer or bass reducer .",[]
the sound became instantly clear again .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
"i do wish i could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !","[('bass', 'neg'), ('sheer volume', 'pos')]"
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them .,"[('small', 'pos')]"
they use a design that has a passive radiator that takes up most of the back of each speaker .,[]
"you get a power\/volume knob , headphone jack , and bluetooth button on the front and power , speaker to speaker , and line-in on the back .",[]
there are a few things that i do n't like about the design .,"[('design', 'neg')]"
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .,"[('speaker grill', 'neg')]"
they used a glossy finish on the front .,[]
i have found that around the knob is all smudged up and scratched now from normal use .,[]
"if would have been much nicer if they had put nubs\/tread around the volume knob , it would have provided a more positive grip and given more feedback .",[]
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone .,"[('knob', 'pos')]"
pairing to a bluetooth device is the usual no problem activity that i have come to expect from creative speakers .,[]
no complaints there .,[]
i also did n't run into any problems using the speakers with any of my bluetooth devices .,[]
when i first setup the speakers i saw a note in the manual to not place the speakers backs against a wall or solid surface .,[]
i sat the speakers on my computer desk at home -lrb- not up against a wall -rrb- and was really meh about how these sounded .,[]
i had decided that i did n't want to keep these at home and decided to take them to work because i did n't need really good sounding speakers at work .,[]
well when i hooked these up in my cubicle at work they sounded like totally different speakers .,[]
i could n't believe how much better they sounded .,[]
so the conclusion i have reached is that placement for these speakers is very important .,[]
they might sound good in your situation they might not .,[]
it is hard to tell .,[]
this is the best speaker mount i had so far .,"[('speaker mount', 'pos')]"
"although i was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .","[('material', 'neg'), ('look', 'neg')]"
this speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .,"[('speaker mount', 'pos'), ('speaker', 'pos')]"
it is what you would expect for a ~ $ 30 dock .,[]
the sound is far from good and there 's a lot of interference mainly when doing any wifi activity .,"[('sound', 'neg')]"
volume level is ok .,"[('volume level', 'pos')]"
material is on the cheap side .,"[('material', 'neg')]"
i was expecting more based on the rest of the comments but i guess for ~ $ 30 is `` ok '',[]
jbl s310 ii is truly amazing .,"[('jbl s310 ii', 'pos')]"
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .,"[('sound', 'pos'), ('bass', 'pos')]"
i own two of these and i have configured these as my front left & right speakers .,[]
"i am using jbl n38 ii as surround left & right , which is again a very nice excellent speaker set .","[('speaker set', 'pos')]"
the rear left & right speakers are jbl n-center ii speakers .,[]
"the center channel is jbl - s - center ii , this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues , and it 's a 3-way speaker system .","[('unit', 'pos'), ('dialogues', 'pos')]"
jbl 150w pb10 sub woofer provides the low frequency effects .,[]

"apart from being very easy to install , and the excellent music quality , what i really find fascinating is discovering new artists with internet radio stations or music providers .","[('install', 'pos'), ('music quality', 'pos')]"
"before sonos i was n't very convinced about internet music , but sonos experience is so rich -lrb- numerous sources -rrb- and easy -lrb- there is almost no setup -rrb- making listening to internet radio a pleasure .",[]
got these for my laptop which has terrible sound volume .,[]
they sound wonderful the only issue is where to put them when i move around .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
these speakers are great .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
they deliver great 5.1 sound when hooked up and actually receiving a 5.1 signal .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
"all of my music outputs in 2\/2 .1 at best except for some flac files , but it puts out the sound for skyrim , movies with the proper audio data , and other similar media with a lot of quality .",[]
"the sub is downfiring and much more compact than my last batch of logitech speakers -lrb- which died after over 7 years of use , a very satisfying roi -rrb- .",[]
"my last set of speakers were logitech and they lasted well past their expected life span with a variety of use and abuse , if these hold up like every other logitech product i 've owned i 'll be very happy .",[]
this review is just a warning to anyone with an 8 ohm amplifier : i originally purchased these because they reviewed well .,[]
"however , they are 4 ohm speakers , and the amp i ordered is 8 ohms .",[]
"the manufacturer 's website says that they are 8 ohms , but when you download the manual , it says the impedance is 4-6 ohms .",[]
i was able to cancel the order before shipping .,[]
-lrb- thanks amazon ! -rrb-,[]
what i found as a replacement for about the same money were the bic america rtrv44-2 .,[]

"so i have ordered these , and they are on their way .",[]
protect your unit and turn on & off speakers where ever you are out side or in ... greg rock on croydon rocks,[]
i had bought a logitech x240 and i knew that i was not going to keep it the very first day as it was merely a big piece of junk .,[]
well it had good power but no precision at all .,"[('power', 'pos')]"
"after reading many reviews about x230 , i ordered it -lrb- through office depot for 34 bucks and free shipping which only took 2 days with ups -rrb- .",[]
"wow , this speaker really rocks .","[('speaker', 'pos')]"
"even with its sub volume all the way down , you will hear the complete spectrum of instruments at different pitches and can recognize them one by one .",[]
the satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .,"[('satellite speakers', 'pos'), ('bass tones', 'pos')]"
really happy with the purchase .,[]
highly recommended .,[]
"after arriving earlier than anticipated , i made a test of two three foot sections .",[]
perfect !,[]

"if you want a quality product , delivered on time , buy this one .","[('quality product', 'pos')]"
tiny .,"[('tiny', 'pos')]"
powerful .,[]
portable .,"[('portable', 'pos')]"
great sound .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
"seriously , i had to turn it down !",[]
"it will `` dance '' a little on the table if it 's turned up really high , which is kinda cute , but you do n't want the little guy to hurt himself , so i put a small piece of that slip guard meant for under rugs and kitchen shelves and it worked wonderfully !",[]
i 'm buying a second one !,[]
just the fact that you can carry all your music and different genres on cards that take up no room at all makes this a huge pro factor for me .,[]
fabulous buy !!!,[]
i 've never owned a surround sound system before this .,[]
and now i do n't think i can go back to the old school stereo again .,[]
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high !,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
i can shake my whole house !,[]
pros : - great sound - sleek cool look - compact - comes with rca adapter - speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted cons : - mainly for pc only -lrb- but works fairly well with tv 's -rrb- - wattage is n't all that high - no immediate line in -lrb- so you ca n't hook your mp3 player up and get srs right out of the box -rrb- i 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .,"[('sound', 'pos'), ('look', 'pos')]"
i disagree .,[]
they are at least 12 feet long and if you need something longer than that you should move up to a home theater system rather than a pc kit .,[]
"note : to experience these speakers to the full , you will need to have a good sound card -lrb- 5 or more ports -rrb- otherwise the rear and center speakers may not work .",[]
you will probally also need to setup the sound card to use 5.1 sound .,[]
this can be done through the control panel - -rrb- sounds and devices - -rrb- advanced and if this does n't work you 'll need to use the software that comes with your sound card and adjust speaker setting to 5.1 .,[]
i have a realtek soundcard and found it in the control panel under the name `` sound effects manager . '',[]
"overall , this is the best 5.1 set for under $ 100 .",[]
i 'd venture to say that because of it 's low cost it 's the best pc stereo set out there costwise .,"[('cost', 'pos')]"
if you buy a 6.1 or 7.1 system you wo n't get that much of a sound improvement other than volume .,[]
"and for a small room , this thing can crank it out enough to hurt your ears !",[]
the audio cube is great .,"[('audio cube', 'pos')]"
"the sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .","[('sound', 'pos'), ('bass', 'pos'), ('unit', 'pos')]"
i bought this unit to use a speaker in the bedroom as well as a nightly dock to charge my ipad and provide additional sound for an alarm app .,[]
it works great for this purpose .,"[('works', 'pos')]"
there is also an additional input to charge\/play music from another non ios device .,[]
i like it because it is soft and flexible that i can run it along the edges of the door .,[]
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
i guess you may want to get some of those tips for the ends to make it easier to connect to the speakers .,[]
this setup worked perfectly the first shot at it .,"[('setup', 'pos')]"
"i did not even have to hit the `` auto tune '' button , it just worked instantly .","[('worked', 'pos')]"
"really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .","[('sound quality', 'pos'), ('volume', 'neg')]"
"if you want background music , better than your tv sound for movies , speakers around the house for parties , outside get togethers , this is about as good as you can expect , for the price .","[('price', 'pos')]"
"i have not had any of the bad issues that i saw in other reviews , and we are very pleased with the purchase .",[]
works great !,"[('works', 'pos')]"
easy to pair !,"[('pair', 'pos')]"
great sound !,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
good battery life !,"[('battery life', 'pos')]"
life is good .,"[('life', 'pos')]"
great gift for any one !,[]
good price !,"[('price', 'pos')]"
the controls are hard to see and not intuitive .,"[('controls', 'neg')]"
"but , adjusting the picture settings is a one time thing for most people .",[]
"when i saw these cables , i could n't have been more excited .",[]
these were the cables from my youth .,[]
i am sure that my appreciation of fine music would never have developed were it not for the audiophile quality sound that these cables were able to extract from my little fischer-price phonograph .,[]
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall .,"[('sound', 'pos')]"
-lrb- if carnegie hall had been built on a cloud in heaven . -rrb-,[]
"so , i traded my prius in for a 1975 dodge dart -lrb- with a built in 8-track - i knew these cables would make that rock -rrb- and chose expedited shipping .",[]
within seconds the confirmation email arrived .,[]
i plugged in the tracking number and was surprised to learn that the item had already been delivered .,[]
back in 1963 !!!!!,[]
so that 's where i got those from .,[]
i thought aunt loretta had sent them .,[]
i mean i guess i got my money 's worth .,[]
i just wish i had n't ruined them by hooking them onto my bicycle spokes with a clothespin .,[]
"oh , well .",[]
"if this kidney sells , i 'll be able to afford another pair .",[]
i 'm a + if anyone is interested .,[]
i have loved my rock speaker for about 3 years .,[]
i have it in my garden .,[]
last summer i thought i 'd like to have 2 more placed around my garden .,[]
since spring is right around the corner i thought now was the time .,[]
i use them with music coming from my computer .,[]
i absolutely love these speakers .,"[('speakers', 'pos')]"
"this phone was advertised as a 3 line phone -- i checked and re-checked tht listing on the description when purchasing -- and now that i want to return it , i get no response from eek technology whom it was purchased from .",[]
\* poorly listed \* no customer service on a return \* wo n't do this again !!!,[]
i ordered harmon kardon soundstick ii and i returned them .,[]
i own harmon kardon soundstick i and i must say that these speakers do n't compare with the harmon kardon soundstick ii .,[]
the sound quality is very poor .,"[('sound quality', 'neg')]"
on a scale of 1-10 i would say it is a 2 at best .,[]
do n't buy these .,[]
harmon kardon should go back to the old style of speakers with the usb instead of the new plugs .,[]
"warning : these speakers are marketed as speakers for your tv , playstation , or dvd player -- not your computer .",[]
they have rca inputs ; they want you to use the enclosed rca cable to connect the audio outputs from your tv\/playstation\/dvd directly to the speakers .,[]
this would be great in a dorm room or bedroom setting where you may not already have a stereo receiver and want better sound than what your tv is giving you .,[]
"if your computer is anything like mine , you will need to get a different cord , in a `` y '' shape , where the `` top '' of the `` y '' are 2 rca male connectors -lrb- these plug into the speakers -rrb- , and the `` bottom '' of the `` y '' is a single male headphone jack connector -lrb- this plugs into your computer -rrb- .",[]
"you can get one of these cable at just about any electronics store for a few bucks , but it would have been nice to have had it included out-of-the-box .",[]
i was bummed to open the box and realize that i could n't enjoy the speakers right away .,[]
": - -lrb- all that being said , the speakers have good sound quality .","[('sound quality', 'pos')]"
"i am using them in my office , and they generally sound good .","[('sound', 'pos')]"
"however , since i am in an office , i normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak .","[('sound', 'neg')]"
"once i turn up the volume a touch , they sound really good .","[('sound', 'pos')]"
"i 'm not sure that any speakers could offer me high fidelity at very low volumes , though .",[]
