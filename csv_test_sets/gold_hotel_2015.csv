My family had 5 rooms at this hotel for one night.,[]
"One room was on one floor, 3 were on another, and the last was way up top.",[]
Being way spread out would have been OK until we got to the rooms.,[]
All 4 lower rooms were 80 degrees and above.,"[('rooms', '17', '12', 'ROOMS#COMFORT', 'negative')]"
We were assured that the rooms would be cool by the time we got back from our concert.,[]

The free shuttle to and from the airport saved us over 30 dollars alone in taxi cab fare (Phoenix Taxi fares are ridiculously expensive) and is also available anywhere downtown.,[]
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Phoenix.,"[('hotel', '35', '30', 'HOTEL#GENERAL', 'positive')]"
