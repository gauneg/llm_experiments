"i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but i suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.",[]

the magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (i even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!,[]
it can't get any better.,[]
"the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless.",[]

no good.,[]
i always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.,[]
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i didn't like the trackpad.,[]

"i've had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.",[]
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.,[]
the materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.,[]
that day!,[]
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.,[]

i bought it during the recent comex it show.,[]
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing.,[]
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises.,[]
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook.,[]
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box!,[]
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can't play it because its not compatable with the software.,[]
i took it back for a full refund.,[]
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed.,[]
"where you click and hold and drag it picture, link, etc to where you want it.",[]
"i had upgraded my old macbook to lion, so i kind of knew what i was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.",[]

i love it!,[]
the #1 reason that is always repeated.,[]
"unfortunately, that is not the case.",[]
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.,[]
no viruses!,[]
it was an all around waste of money for me.,[]
i worked in it retail sales before.,[]
it has everything you need to get the job done.,[]
"i feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.",[]
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.,[]
"finally, i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time.",[]
its not bad just very very annoying.,[]
"well, maybe more like week one.",[]
"i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day, 4-6 days a week.",[]
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.,[]
i liked the aluminum body.,[]

"sorry, newegg.",[]
originally bought it for my wife.,[]
"now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.",[]
"buy it, love it, and i promise you won't regret it.",[]
"call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.",[]
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.,[]
great overall.,[]
my smart phone is faster!,[]
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control+alt+delete business anymore.,[]
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!,[]
"so, buyers beware!",[]
"i have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.",[]
definitely recommended!!!,[]
let me start with the good:so awesome.,[]
i had finally reached my limit and broke down.,[]
"for the bluetooth to work properly, you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd, or it will not show after the reload.",[]
everything is falling apart internally and externally.,[]
"it super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.",[]
"it's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they can't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome.",[]
its a dog plain and simple.,[]
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.,[]
they refuse.,[]
big mistake!,[]
i am just amazed.,[]
"i burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so i can place it there.",[]
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and i wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.,[]
"also, hdd secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.",[]
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.,[]
just don't waste your time and money on this.,[]
"i have a lapdesk which i can use, but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic.",[]
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it.,[]
it was over rated!,[]
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit.,[]
i wasn't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money!,[]
"even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.",[]
"they are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.",[]
"heck, if i had enough ' money, i would but it as a gift for someone.",[]
"even so, i like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows.",[]
i have not have any problems.,[]
the nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.,[]
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.,[]
"two, owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone.",[]
sent unit back and it's been two months.,[]
came fully loaded - good.,[]
(i definatly can't).,[]
"files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.",[]
it is meant to be portable.,[]
my laptop worked again for just a while before i started having issues again.,[]
this is perfect for her field.,[]
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase,[]
that's the downside for me.,[]
hopefully amazon will take this back.,[]
he can't stand it.,[]
"looking online, many people are having the same problem.",[]
theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.,[]
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.,[]
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase.,[]
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing.,[]
went silently.,[]
satisfy what i paid for it.,[]
so you don't get frustrated the first few weeks.,[]
"they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty, and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore.",[]
and if u did.,[]
it was definelty a smart move.,[]
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached.,[]
sure hope best buy will replace it asap.,[]
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do.,[]
just what the doctor ordered.,[]
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed.,[]
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner.,[]
"i did a review on it, its awesome.",[]
with the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.,[]
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue.,[]
"the driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.",[]
do your research on this issue.,[]
it has happened again and i'm being told that it's $175.,[]
no big deal.,[]
"mine came at $1,700 w/o a dvd burner (!).",[]
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd'd during that time!,[]
but you must get the 15 inch.,[]
please make these!,[]
"again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.",[]
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it.,[]
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.,[]
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable.,[]
"it's fun to take to a bookstore, sit in the coffee shop area, sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy.",[]
"not super fancy, but not super expensive either.",[]
i had to call hp and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.,[]
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well.,[]
"when typing, letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences.",[]
"only a few days after i received the computer back, the screen froze again.",[]
it is not ideal for children because of the temp.,[]
"sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!",[]
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything.,[]
that includes transferring my music and movies.,[]
"took that one home, same thing.",[]
and it is impossible to get them back in.,[]
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.,[]
it's solid.,[]
"it lasted for many years of travel, kids and abuse and if i fired it up today, it would work.",[]
"it freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it.",[]
"it is not even a year old yet, so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone.",[]
"newegg's rma service was great as always, i contacted them late friday night, and they issued me an rma number and a prepaid ups shipping label the very next morning on saturday.",[]
i'm very impressed.,[]
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!,[]
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it!,[]
"yes, i have it on the highest available setting.",[]
not to mention it has shit gigs.,[]
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.,[]
i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning.,[]
this thing is a lemon.,[]
"we now own two of these, identical.",[]
"once you go mac, you can't go back!",[]
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.,[]
"they're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.",[]
"if that is the case for you, i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases.",[]
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat.,[]
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there.,[]
"it is very durable, i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.",[]
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to louisville ky.,[]
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would.,[]
fan noise: the fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.,[]
"i believe this is because i was more active than the average user, meaning i average about three ""tabs"".",[]
best buy rocks!,[]
a couple things you should know:,[]
all the yada-yada.,[]
""" this isn't a big deal, i haven't noticed the issue with dvds or other media, only through usb output.",[]
i love it!,[]
"i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp, but i use the touchpad 90% of the time.",[]
two of the times was in one month.,[]
"so needless to day, i'm not happy.",[]
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.,[]
"although i was promised about 10 hours, i found myself to a limited 7 hours (which is still amazing).",[]
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up!,[]
"the only thing that can be updated is the video, other than that you're all set.",[]
it wasn't worth it.,[]
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.,[]
i had less problems.,[]
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan.,[]
but not in this case.,[]
i do not know for sure.,[]
every single one we've gotten we've had problems with.,[]
"(if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it shouldn't, check the ""activity monitor"" app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero.",[]
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash.,[]
return it.,[]
that was a big mistake.,[]
"the processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.",[]
"even though it is running snow leopard, 2.4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel.",[]
seriously why haven't they just replaced it by now.,[]
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.,[]
"it is a big big, but since it has a 18.4"" screen what would you expect!",[]
i have never had an experience like this.,[]
we haven't had any problems with it at all.,[]
returned it to walmart.,[]
i love everything about it.,[]
all was well.,[]
he said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue.,[]
not worth it one bit.,[]
"first of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty i'd paid almost $400 for, and i had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.",[]
"i hate to say this, but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then i would.",[]
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.,[]
"being only 2 months old, i am not a happy camper!",[]
"such as pages, numbers, and so on.",[]
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.,[]
i loved it.,[]
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.,[]
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.,[]
"i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one, but imo no stars",[]
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer service agents for those who live in the united states.,[]
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.,[]
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.,[]
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.,[]
never been hacked.,[]
it's so bad that i'm thinking i only got half a battery or something.,[]
i think it was seventy nine plus tax.,[]
"in summary, take your money elsewhere.",[]
so this was great for me.,[]
another problem.,[]
"the ""time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.",[]
pay attention to the specs if you want these options.,[]
"stupidly, mind-numbingly slow--then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb *maximum*.",[]
it also does not have bluetooth.,[]
i can do pretty much 75% of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table.,[]
"during that time, i had to send it back 3 times.",[]
i left the place angrily.,[]
very annoying.,[]
my main reason to convert was the imovie program.,[]
it may take a little getting used to but you don't have to worry about viruses or other headaches.,[]
"it is so great, i can hardly ever take my hands off it!",[]
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused.,[]
"not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved, worked on and opened on both a pc and mac, the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior.",[]
by air sounds more like by truck to me.,[]
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped.,[]
it's outstanding too.,[]
so i'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.,[]
"some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.",[]
just chill and enjoy.,[]
i should have sent it back to them then.,[]
don't waste your money or time.,[]
this is starting off good.,[]
moral of the story:-do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.,[]
each time taking about 1 day or so.,[]
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.,[]
"so a couple of years later, i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet.",[]
"in my line of work, i often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.",[]
"they told me to reprogram the computer, and i didn't need to do that, and i lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life.",[]
i hate it.,[]
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection.,[]
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this!,[]
plus stylish.,[]
"unless you don't care how long it takes to get going, find something else.",[]
(you may be reading one now!,[]
this is the first apple product that i have purchased.,[]
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it.,[]
enough said.,[]
i do not plan on going back.,[]
"called tech support and got the usual acer ""we don't support software but for $$$ we can help you"" i explained there was no software involved in booting.",[]
i would never tell anyone to buy one either.,[]
i can't say enough good for it!,[]
comfterbale to use light easy to transport.,[]
"it crashes, and when it goes flat, it just dies (like a pc, maybe worse) and i loose all my open documents!",[]
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.,[]
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well.,[]
""" then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it wasn't like that.",[]
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.,[]
what a mistake!,[]
"three years is a decent life, but this must make it to graduation and beyond.",[]
then it ceased charging at all.,[]
"i am not much of a computer techie, so i can understand some of the internal problems, though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program.",[]
i like it!,[]
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him.,[]
its still going.,[]
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.,[]
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.,[]
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.,[]
the computer blinks it shuts off at will.,[]
"i have vista, so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs.",[]
"i can do everything i could before, only faster and more efficiently.",[]
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.,[]
two times with in one month.,[]
"if it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.",[]
"c'mon, lg.",[]
"if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing, all craziness may break loose.",[]
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.,[]
take your time and go through the tutorials patiently.,[]
"when i got it, i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive.",[]
they only stay charged a little over an hour.,[]
"the 4 usb ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.",[]
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.,[]
i try to use it today and i can't logon.,[]
"when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service, on my eee pc i get 3 bars.",[]
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.,[]
the letter a stopped working after the first week.,[]
this is what i call a good after sales service.,[]
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.,[]
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could.,[]
tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.,[]
however the frozen screens kept happening.,[]
"honestly, i spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what i got on there for!",[]
no i am generous calling it slow.,[]
"the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.",[]
"i called back to ensure that received it, they had.",[]
"now, the next issue i had freaked me out.",[]
they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.,[]
i fell in love with it.,[]
"it was just one problem after another for me, and that's reason we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.",[]
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....,[]
couldnt not use it.,[]
"i sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so i got a new one and some other fixes they found.",[]
they didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.,[]
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.,[]
i take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.,[]
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.,[]
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good.,[]
"they went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.",[]
"while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down, this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i've used.",[]
bought with a credit card.,[]
""" i've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it.",[]
i did not take the class and wish that i would have.,[]
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.,[]
not good for a person who gets online daily.,[]
"i can't even remember how i finally got it taken care of, but i was done with sony after that!",[]
so it was only about 2 weeks ago.,[]
there is nothing better.,[]
"it is known as safari, and if you are doing any website work, you should know that many hosting companies do not support it.",[]
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.,[]
i have used a couple of others on the job as well.,[]
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating.,[]
"those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall? yeah, i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.",[]
i don't really have a complaint.,[]
i'm pretty sure it's not newegg's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop.,[]
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there.,[]
"so i called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, i just chose to hide the message.",[]
enough said.,[]
my son said it popped up and he clicked update.,[]
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening.,[]
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.,[]
"the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating, even if on for less than an hour!",[]
good luck with your purchase options.,[]
very disappointed!,[]
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.,[]
unless you need the bluetooth 3.,[]
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically.,[]
"however, if i sound enthusiastic about this, i am!",[]
you will fall in love with it in no time.,[]
"on 3 july 2004, i purcased this model at best buy for about $150",[]
i went with him and we picked this one.,[]
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs.,[]
"mom, dad, brother, sister, you name it!",[]
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.,[]
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid.,[]
"u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.",[]
it's the most wonderful thing in the entire world.,[]
