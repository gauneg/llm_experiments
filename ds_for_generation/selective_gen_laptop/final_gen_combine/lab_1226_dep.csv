i use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.,[]
moral of the story:-do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.,[]
it was over rated!,[]
you will fall in love with it in no time.,[]
and inconvenient!,[]
it's very annoying.,[]
i should have been more observant.,[]
i love it!,[]
i love it!,[]
i love it!,[]
i love it!,[]
i thought it would be a simple job.,[]
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening.,[]
i got what i paid for.,[]
"for me, five stars is not enough.",[]
"i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and ""fixed"" the edges by rounding them off.",[]
i am glad i did my research.,[]
"after purchasing this thing, i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.",[]
more relieved than anything.,[]
you pay for what you get for.,[]
and this isn't just my one experine.,[]
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling.,[]
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.,[]
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!,[]
"in fact, he said, about 10% of their products fail.",[]
very disappointed!,[]
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town.,[]
each time taking about 1 day or so.,[]
very very disappointed!,[]
i take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.,[]
"it's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's great!",[]
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer.,[]
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer service agents for those who live in the united states.,[]
"however, this will be my last as well.",[]
i really wish i had done this years ago.,[]
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.,[]
my friends are in awe every time they come over!,[]
"there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when i click on it it says: "" consider replacing your battery"" and it does not hold full charge.",[]
"so needless to day, i'm not happy.",[]
"yeah, to you.",[]
would buy 100 more of these if i could.,[]
5) cut my losses and sold it for parts,[]
it was a tough choice.,[]
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.,[]
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.,[]
i hate it!,[]
i hate it!,[]
"i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one, but imo no stars",[]
they claim call center is still down.,[]
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing.,[]
i had finally reached my limit and broke down.,[]
but not in this case.,[]
it all just makes sense.,[]
"if that is the case for you, i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases.",[]
again.,[]
good luck.,[]
i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash.,[]
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.,[]
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating.,[]
very annoying.,[]
i pondered very long over this decision.,[]
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything.,[]
they only stay charged a little over an hour.,[]
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.,[]
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.,[]
i like it!,[]
i'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross.,[]
i am taking back today.,[]
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.,[]
no good.,[]
what's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it doesn't keep what i put here are my aratings,[]
either way i'm furious.,[]
they click.,[]
they have not sent a new one nor called.,[]
dismantle the whole thing? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before.,[]
"no luck, although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).",[]
"i called back to ensure that received it, they had.",[]
would do business again.,[]
"call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.",[]
"i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased.",[]
that's how frustrating it was.,[]
"most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.",[]
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .,[]
stay away from envy.,[]
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.,[]
"it doesn't have a lot of frills, but i didn't need any, and being able to buy what i needed, and not more than i needed was very important.",[]
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.,[]
so don't get it.,[]
it's catatonic.,[]
"oh, boy!",[]
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills .,[]
i hate it.,[]
"i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface, which is useful for time machine.",[]
"they're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.",[]
"so, i went back.",[]
"well, maybe i was just very unlucky.",[]
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.,[]
"first, it does not have a push button to open the lid.",[]
"i'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!",[]
so i'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.,[]
"who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing? so, i said i wanted a new set.",[]
"help, help, other than that gets a great little wonder.",[]
"by the way teachers, they offer a discount which helps!",[]
its a dog plain and simple.,[]
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.,[]
these new problems were the final straws;,[]
"took that one home, same thing.",[]
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.,[]
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.,[]
"i am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.",[]
i can't honestly say i was heartbroken.,[]
the #1 reason that is always repeated.,[]
my kids (and dogs) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them.,[]
they are about the same size keys.,[]
i did not take the class and wish that i would have.,[]
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do.,[]
his was worth $36.,[]
(you may be reading one now!,[]
i am a freelance graphic artist.,[]
i loved it.,[]
ok first.,[]
now i know!,[]
"we didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!",[]
gave phonenumber.,[]
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan.,[]
i was psyched.,[]
enjoy your sitdown,[]
not the day received.,[]
i did not have to call the support line at all.,[]
so it was only about 2 weeks ago.,[]
time will tell.,[]
we did not even have it a year.,[]
"but, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.",[]
"it's not a recommendation, it' a plea.",[]
big mistake!,[]
falls into the case.,[]
"in summary, take your money elsewhere.",[]
this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.,[]
"this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!",[]
it's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.,[]
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook.,[]
"-they say it will take ""up to two weeks"".",[]
at first!,[]
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.,[]
"i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches, dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen.",[]
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that.,[]
hope this helped!,[]
"for two months, when you guessed it.",[]
"the ""time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.",[]
and it is impossible to get them back in.,[]
that day!,[]
hope this helps!,[]
there is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.,[]
this has happened three times so far.,[]
apparently they're not special anymore .,[]
probbly the worst decision we ever made!,[]
"so i'd pop them off to see what the problem was, well guess what? the darn thing wouldn't go back on.",[]
that's a huge difference.,[]
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going.,[]
i do not plan on going back.,[]
"the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the ""repair"".",[]
it was a total dhell experience that i will never repeat.,[]
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!,[]
"after 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.",[]
it was a laugh too!,[]
"being only 2 months old, i am not a happy camper!",[]
"then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.",[]
what a mistake!,[]
"i shipped out on saturday, july 17.",[]
"she told me flatly, ""it's like that one.",[]
i do not know for sure.,[]
i love this little one.,[]
went silently.,[]
but in fact it is totally the opposite.,[]
"where you click and hold and drag it picture, link, etc to where you want it.",[]
hieroglyphics are quite common.,[]
should be there by the end of the week (again...).,[]
it was shooting sparks!,[]
which was way too much money.,[]
two times with in one month.,[]
they are not.,[]
it's a joke.,[]
perfect trifecta!,[]
i don't know how i could ever live without my qousmio.,[]
sad very sad.,[]
"so i called, again.",[]
just chill and enjoy.,[]
we decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.,[]
will not every buy another--------lou,[]
just a bunch of idiots who's english as a 5th language is forced at best.,[]
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.,[]
a lot of help they weren't!,[]
those things are very important - vital even!,[]
its more like a snail crawl.,[]
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.,[]
all i can say is w-o-w.,[]
and if u did.,[]
go for it!,[]
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country.,[]
"-called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement, no answer.",[]
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not!,[]
that was a big mistake.,[]
"though you get a polite person, you often don t get a solution.",[]
"-when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them, i tried to call.",[]
he can't stand it.,[]
"that seemed to solve the problem, till i wrote an article with semicolons in it.",[]
"but then, something goes wrong.",[]
they will not let you down.,[]
just what the doctor ordered.,[]
it is held in place magnetically.,[]
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.,[]
lord have mercy!,[]
two of the times was in one month.,[]
"now, the next issue i had freaked me out.",[]
"so, i must say i am not a happy camper.",[]
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would have taken the class.,[]
"to this day, there are none.",[]
(i definatly can't).,[]
now they are believers in the product.,[]
-stay away from machouse amsterdam.,[]
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me.,[]
this ain't it.,[]
all the yada-yada.,[]
winters is on it's way and i imagine it will be cozy.,[]
i hate this one.,[]
they are so realistic i am just speechless.,[]
"well, maybe more like week one.",[]
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses!,[]
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.,[]
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up!,[]
received all four in good order;,[]
oh my goodness-i am not a happy camper.,[]
"no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state (or more often, another country).",[]
it's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.,[]
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!,[]
it was definelty a smart move.,[]
i left the place angrily.,[]
"this was around three years, maybe four years ago.",[]
"-complied to their protocol, called number, made ""case"", got an email address to send complaint.",[]
but i was wrong.,[]
"if it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.",[]
"to list a few: they tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns, as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up.",[]
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.,[]
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.,[]
it was weird.,[]
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first.,[]
back she goes!,[]
i was starting to boil.,[]
i was wrong!,[]
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.,[]
"mom, dad, brother, sister, you name it!",[]
"well, they don't care a bunch.",[]
"in addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.",[]
"he left me, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......",[]
by air sounds more like by truck to me.,[]
i think it was seventy nine plus tax.,[]
"long story, but after many calls to various offices, i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers don't take phone calls or e/mails.",[]
they refuse.,[]
please make these!,[]
you may need to special order a bag.,[]
i went with him and we picked this one.,[]
"after they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.",[]
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.,[]
they are closed at 9pm eastern.,[]
"the rep did not even answer my question, i had to ask him, if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.",[]
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically.,[]
english must have been his third or fourth language.,[]
we don't mind and you don't matter.,[]
"and then, a guy came out to serve me instead.",[]
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.,[]
