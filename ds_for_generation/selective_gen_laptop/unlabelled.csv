i bought a hp pavilion dv4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.,[]
i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl.,[]
"the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town- lots of people, little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector, etc.",[]
sad very sad.,[]
"i even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, ichat, photobooth, garage band and more!",[]
needless to say a pc that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!,[]
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.,[]
"still pretty pricey, but i've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund, and finally got to use it.",[]
i took it back for an asus and same thing- blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset.,[]
"in the shop, these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).",[]
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work.,[]
i hate this one.,[]
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.,[]
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.,[]
"oh, boy!",[]
but while this is one big advantage (as you may know from the company s recent commercials) there are other things to consider before going with apple.,[]
on the bright side at least i wasn't without my laptop for long this time!,[]
that's how frustrating it was.,[]
i can't even turn it off.,[]
"one suggestion i do have, is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc.",[]
i shopped around before buying.,[]
"i also got the added bonus of a 30"" hd monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!",[]
would do business again.,[]
i have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.,[]
what a waste.,[]
it was a total dhell experience that i will never repeat.,[]
there are a few flaws as well that i noticed.,[]
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel.,[]
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem.,[]
:) in the past four years i've had it i have never once gotten a virus.,[]
"they were great in handling this problem, and i'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future.",[]
i've tried going back to xl but there still problems.,[]
"after numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in bios setup directly), i gave up(i am a techie).",[]
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country.,[]
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.,[]
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device.,[]
it cannot save the correct date and time i set.,[]
i sent it back to toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty.,[]
and this isn't just my one experine.,[]
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.,[]
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for.,[]
i would highly recommend this one to my friends,[]
"i honestly love my mac, thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict.",[]
and these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro.,[]
also kinda loud when the fan was running.,[]
"in desparation, i called their customer service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me (""have your credit card ready"").",[]
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email.,[]
-they lost my laptop for a month,[]
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support.,[]
"this is my second laptop,and it is head and shoulders above my first.",[]
at first!,[]
i think just going from pc to mac has gotten me totally spoiled and i can't imagine ever going back.,[]
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.,[]
"it's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's great!",[]
it's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.,[]
"still under warrenty so called toshiba, no help at all.",[]
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty.,[]
i love it!,[]
"i mainly use it for email, internet, and managing personal files (pics, vids, etc.).",[]
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.,[]
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.,[]
"if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.",[]
"*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-called headquarters, they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is ""on the top of the stack"".",[]
then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro.,[]
i complain again...,[]
"if a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.",[]
"it's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!",[]
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac.,[]
this is now my 3rd macbook pro and i really honestly love it!,[]
for 2 months.,[]
"i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.",[]
do you ever think hp would do that? never!,[]
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.,[]
it's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it.,[]
still trying to learn how to use it.,[]
"the reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my documents folder.",[]
i bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.,[]
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.,[]
we'll save our money to replace it with a mac again!,[]
"then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.",[]
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.,[]
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.,[]
the apple mc371ll/a 2.4ghz 15.4-inch macbook pro notebook is a horrible waste of money.,[]
"as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom,,,about 4 inches across is hardly visible.",[]
good luck.,[]
"my favorite by far, although the most expensive, was my sony.",[]
"and if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key.",[]
also i typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying.,[]
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy.,[]
"i shipped out on saturday, july 17.",[]
i bought it for really cheap also and it's amazing.,[]
"acer has set me up with free recovery discs, when they are available since i asked.",[]
"i also purchased office max's ""max assurance"" with the ""no lemon"" clause.",[]
if you find yourself in the market for a new laptop (and have the money) don't exclude looking at the mbps.,[]
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb.,[]
those things are very important - vital even!,[]
"-they say it will take ""up to two weeks"".",[]
i didn't like one thing about it.,[]
"yeah, to you.",[]
i got a mac as my hs graduation gift.,[]
i have now had it for 1.5 months and love it.,[]
it turned out it's not really a problem to have a mac.,[]
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.,[]
images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.,[]
going to bring it to service today.,[]
"there is no need to purchase virus protection for mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.",[]
"but we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.",[]
"so, i paid a visit to lg notebook service center at alexandra road, hoping they can make the hinge tighter.",[]
"my daughter uses it for games, email, facebook, pictures and music.",[]
laptop is to be used like a netbook.,[]
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard.,[]
"trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient.",[]
"it was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!",[]
they had to replace the motherboard in april,[]
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.,[]
"also, i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.",[]
it was a great deal after all.,[]
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense.,[]
gave phonenumber.,[]
oh my goodness-i am not a happy camper.,[]
dell's customer disservice is an insult to it's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.,[]
"yet, hp won't do anything about the problem.",[]
i'm returning mine,[]
"i can render avchd movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core i7.",[]
it's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.,[]
"this is what they told me: it heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.",[]
"after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook.",[]
"if you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run windows applications, go with an apple;",[]
you won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.,[]
one of them seems to have worked.,[]
which i still use and have hooked up to my tv.,[]
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that.,[]
you may need to special order a bag.,[]
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession.,[]
"i've owned every ""pro"" model apple laptop for the last 8 years, this is by far the worst one i've ever had.",[]
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business.,[]
"have purchased many products over the years from macconnection and this transaction, like all the others, we smoothly with no problems.",[]
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it.,[]
i'm pleased.,[]
"with a healthy pessimism, i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw.",[]
i thought the white mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing.,[]
"don't waste their money, save it and but a mac.",[]
money and time well spent!,[]
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc.,[]
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there.,[]
both my husband and i have this model toshiba.,[]
"no complaints with their desktop, and maybe because it just sits on your desktop, and you don't carry it around, which could jar the hard drive, or the motherboard.",[]
"since i keyboard over 100 wpm, i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange configuration of ""extra key"", etc.",[]
) i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store.,[]
"it gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.",[]
lots of preloaded software.,[]
"sony, acer, dell, packard bell and toshiba.",[]
"and then, a guy came out to serve me instead.",[]
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late!,[]
have returned that laptop unused.,[]
will probably never buy a hp again.,[]
i got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year.,[]
i should have been more observant.,[]
"i wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!",[]
"when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it, taped it shut resold it as new.",[]
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.,[]
would pay more for it if i had too!,[]
couldn't keep a page up you were working on!,[]
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.,[]
"the bluetooth was not there at all, and the fingerprint reader driver would be there, but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done.",[]
i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.,[]
i was given a mac as a birthday present and couldn't be happier with it 3 years later.,[]
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.,[]
"they improved nothing else such as resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.",[]
"i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but i suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.",[]
is this partially due to the fact that it is running windows vista?,[]
"you might think, i am new in this game, but i am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast.",[]
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first.,[]
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school.,[]
"1) payed $2200 for a ""premium"" laptop",[]
do not purchase this laptop.,[]
"she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that ""it is like that one"".",[]
"i ordered through macmall, which saved me the sales tax i would have incurred buying locally.",[]
very fast and efficient!,[]
being virus-resistant is a huge plus.,[]
"the brand of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that apple started it all.",[]
"by the way teachers, they offer a discount which helps!",[]
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet.,[]
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac.,[]
it is held in place magnetically.,[]
taking it back to best buy i found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken (manuf issue).,[]
we were pc users.,[]
after that the said it was under warranty.,[]
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.,[]
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.,[]
"the tech store i purchased this from sent it back,,,,,eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later.",[]
"i loved it then, but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet.",[]
"i will never again buy another acer, not will i buy gateway, or emachine as they are all from the same company.",[]
"i thought learning the mac os would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc.",[]
"my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them ""de-bugged"".",[]
it was a laugh too!,[]
i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.,[]
i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.,[]
it is a bit heavy.,[]
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.,[]
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor.,[]
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers.,[]
runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product.,[]
this was the second computer and brand bought that day.,[]
buy this.,[]
very disappointing:,[]
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.,[]
this is my first computer purchase,[]
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling.,[]
"i have had several machines over the years, both for personal and business use.",[]
well i got this computer from best buy and i have had nothing but problems i bought the computer with a virus.....,[]
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating vista.,[]
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store.,[]
"in the three years i've had my macbook pro, i have never had a virus on my computer, and i do a lot of work on the internet.",[]
"i was ready to take it back for a refund, but the geek squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.",[]
it can't get any better.,[]
"all the problems i have had with pc's are solved with a mac: the issue of overheating-my dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off, and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my hp completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it, with no inexpensive way of fixing it.",[]
"the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless.",[]
in short i would never buy a compaq again.,[]
"i love the 15"" macbook pro.",[]
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was.,[]
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the hp brand because of the problems with their warrentys.,[]
but i was wrong.,[]
no good.,[]
i always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.,[]
"they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when i got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my cd drive wasn't reading anything!",[]
once i removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.,[]
"obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the ""human interface.",[]
"yeah, of course smarty pants ""fix it now"")software - compared to the early 2011 edition i did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to apple (which i promptly did).",[]
the i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos.,[]
"with a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.",[]
summary: dont buy hp.,[]
"i think part of the problem with this computer is vista, yet i know vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista (i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).",[]
you'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.,[]
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.,[]
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.,[]
"it has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.",[]
"-i give up on my data, i just want a computer reasonably fast...",[]
would buy 100 more of these if i could.,[]
"while it was barely a bargin in the begining, i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others.",[]
it was shooting sparks!,[]
mac is not made for gaming.,[]
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.,[]
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently.,[]
the materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.,[]
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.,[]
that day!,[]
""" for one, i noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds.",[]
it does not even have the software to play a dvd now.,[]
my brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an apple.,[]
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.,[]
"since i never really got to use this, i can't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them.",[]
buyers beware.,[]
i'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.,[]
"upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told, was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired.",[]
love it.,[]
"i use that alot on my desktop, so i am adjusting to not having it.",[]
"laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.",[]
"very dissappointed becase i have had toshibas for years, and never a issue.",[]
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac!,[]
congratulations asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop.,[]
i recommend for word processing and internet users.,[]
"when the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.",[]
falls into the case.,[]
this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.,[]
"mac computers automatically ""defrag"" each time you start your computer.",[]
that is my only complaint!,[]
that system is fixed.,[]
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase.,[]
"honestly, this is absolutely wonderful.",[]
i 'have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty.,[]
i really wish i had done this years ago.,[]
"well, maybe i was just very unlucky.",[]
"for example, when my husband turns the light out while i'm on the computer.",[]
loaded with bloatware.,[]
"if you buy, pray you dont have major prolems.",[]
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again.,[]
"well, they don't care a bunch.",[]
recommended to people as their first laptop.,[]
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations.,[]
they have not sent a new one nor called.,[]
i also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things i liked about this laptop.,[]
"have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion.",[]
thinking about returning it,[]
"i took the laptop home and not even a month later, i began to have problems with it.",[]
i tried turning it done but it did nothing.,[]
"it is super fast, and always loads.",[]
i bought mine from apple store the day it was released as amazon didn't have it yet.,[]
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.,[]
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.,[]
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago.,[]
i am very pleased with my purchase!,[]
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki,[]
"however, i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton.",[]
love it so far.,[]
there is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.,[]
"in short, you could say your mac could become your best friend (no intention of replacing rover your dog).",[]
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance.,[]
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on pc's.,[]
"the notebook pc,toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.",[]
"the processor screams, and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.",[]
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town.,[]
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv.,[]
"the apple will run internet explorer, but at an amazingly slow rate.",[]
"with today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.",[]
other than that i don't have one complaint in the world!,[]
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be.,[]
*5 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer.,[]
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade.,[]
this has happened three times so far.,[]
"i'm a professional consultant, and a client needed work on her machine.",[]
compresses itself and you can't use it.,[]
microsoft word was not on it andi had to buy it seperately.,[]
"it has 3 usb ports, 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.",[]
"who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing? so, i said i wanted a new set.",[]
"i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface, which is useful for time machine.",[]
"if you already own a 2009, 2010, or early 2011 model, you should wait until the next update.",[]
"my toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.",[]
"so, i must say i am not a happy camper.",[]
"-called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement, no answer.",[]
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid (i have tried both motorola and htc) plugged into the usb port.,[]
i bought it during the recent comex it show.,[]
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing.,[]
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook.,[]
do you think the shop will give me a new set?? it will not!,[]
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box!,[]
my macbook was worth (after 3 years of use!) $375.,[]
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc.,[]
bought this gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007.,[]
with a mac computer i have more free time as i don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.,[]
"with all the goodies inside this machine, it is a value.",[]
i took it back for a full refund.,[]
"where you click and hold and drag it picture, link, etc to where you want it.",[]

windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning.,[]

after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs.,[]
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.,[]
i love it!,[]
the #1 reason that is always repeated.,[]
"unfortunately, that is not the case.",[]
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.,[]
it's face and depanable.,[]
no viruses!,[]
"i'm just really happy that i waited to buy, because this thing kicks a$$!",[]
"the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop, before this i had a dell desktop that i loved.",[]

i worked in it retail sales before.,[]
it has everything you need to get the job done.,[]
"finally, i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time.",[]

"well, maybe more like week one.",[]
"after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish, i broke down and spent another $100 to get microsoft word for mac.",[]

"now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.",[]
"buy it, love it, and i promise you won't regret it.",[]
i needed a driver for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over $50 for it.,[]

"call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.",[]
"just a month and a half or two months ago, my vaio crashed again.",[]
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.,[]
"a coupla months later, they change my hard drive.",[]
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am.,[]
"the 13"" macbook pro is portable, durable, and very capable.",[]
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.,[]
great overall.,[]
my smart phone is faster!,[]
they say sorry out of warranty.,[]
i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control+alt+delete business anymore.,[]

"there are several programs for school or office use (pages, numbers, keynote, etc.), music (garageband), photo management (photo booth, iphoto), video-editing or movie-making (imovie), etc.",[]
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro.,[]
the love part of my relationship with this laptop doesn't take very long.,[]
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!,[]
that's a huge difference.,[]
"so, buyers beware!",[]
"i have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.",[]
"again, i sent it off to acer, by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything, but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance.",[]
definitely recommended!!!,[]
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive.,[]
let me start with the good:so awesome.,[]
i had finally reached my limit and broke down.,[]
"for the bluetooth to work properly, you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd, or it will not show after the reload.",[]
i waited and waited and no laptop.,[]
everything is falling apart internally and externally.,[]
"it super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.",[]
"it's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they can't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome.",[]
its a dog plain and simple.,[]
my hp is very heavy.,[]
i bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot mgr.,[]
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.,[]
they refuse.,[]
big mistake!,[]
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764.,[]
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....,[]
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net =) when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba!,[]
"first of all, i've been dell fan for more than fifteen years.",[]
great investment!,[]
i am just amazed.,[]
"i burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so i can place it there.",[]
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and i wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.,[]
"i can actually get work done with this mac, and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop.",[]
"also, hdd secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.",[]
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.,[]
just don't waste your time and money on this.,[]
"(beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.",[]
"and i'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !",[]
games being the main issue.,[]
"while the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak, there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world.",[]
"i am definitely sold, and not going back to pcs for home use!",[]
"i have a lapdesk which i can use, but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic.",[]
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it.,[]
it was over rated!,[]
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit.,[]
i wasn't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money!,[]
other thoughts: do not purchase this product.,[]
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters.,[]
"thank god for ""ctrl z""bottom line, i've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there.",[]
bought it to use mostly for oline classes.,[]
"even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.",[]
"also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.",[]
"heck, if i had enough ' money, i would but it as a gift for someone.",[]
"even so, i like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows.",[]
my previous purchases were with dell and hp.,[]
i have not have any problems.,[]
i purchased an hp right after my high school graduation.,[]
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09.,[]
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all.,[]
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.,[]
"two, owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone.",[]
sent unit back and it's been two months.,[]
came fully loaded - good.,[]
"when we bought our new hp comouter in dec. of 2008, we wanted windows xp, but were told it would cost an extra $159, so we went with vista.",[]
(i definatly can't).,[]
"files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.",[]
it is meant to be portable.,[]
my laptop worked again for just a while before i started having issues again.,[]
this is perfect for her field.,[]
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase,[]
that's the downside for me.,[]
"the only thing that i have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.",[]
hopefully amazon will take this back.,[]
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!,[]
"i'm still within the one year warranty but the repair ""depot"" has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered.",[]
but i needed a laptop for school use.,[]
he can't stand it.,[]
the only thing that i don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to.,[]
"looking online, many people are having the same problem.",[]
"wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.",[]
this is my second mac book pro.,[]
"all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler, quicker, and easier.",[]
theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.,[]
i went right out and purchased another laptop.,[]
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.,[]
"i already own an iphone, and so the move just made more sense.",[]
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase.,[]
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing.,[]
went silently.,[]
satisfy what i paid for it.,[]
it is trash!,[]
"overall though, for the money spent it's a great deal.",[]
so you don't get frustrated the first few weeks.,[]
"they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty, and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore.",[]
it is truly a desktop replacement.,[]
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.,[]
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either.,[]
and if u did.,[]
it was definelty a smart move.,[]
sure hope best buy will replace it asap.,[]
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do.,[]
handles all my basic media needs easily.,[]
just what the doctor ordered.,[]
"it has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.",[]
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed.,[]
it's a mac!!,[]
it was weird.,[]
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner.,[]
4gb of ram...,[]
"i did a review on it, its awesome.",[]
"before we got this laptop, had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems.",[]
with the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.,[]
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue.,[]
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17-inch macbook pro.,[]
i will never go back to windows!,[]
do your research on this issue.,[]
"looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level, i decided to purchase the mbp 15in intel core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop.",[]
"hp pavilion dv9000 notebook pc when i first got this computer, it really rocked.",[]
it has happened again and i'm being told that it's $175.,[]
"bigger hd, better graphics card, and a bid hd.",[]
lord have mercy!,[]
no big deal.,[]
"mine came at $1,700 w/o a dvd burner (!).",[]
but you must get the 15 inch.,[]
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy.,[]
please make these!,[]
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.,[]
"my son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind, and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school.",[]
"before i bought my new i5, i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability, dependable, and long lasting operations.",[]
dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime i called them with a problem.,[]
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it.,[]
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years.,[]
may be better for the occasional web surfer.,[]
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.,[]
obviously we both got new macs.,[]
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable.,[]
"it's fun to take to a bookstore, sit in the coffee shop area, sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy.",[]
"not super fancy, but not super expensive either.",[]
keyboard good sized and wasy to use.,[]
hp said it was out of warranty.,[]
"-stay away from apple, or hope you laptop does not break down.",[]
it's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs.,[]
i had to call hp and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.,[]
"when typing, letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences.",[]
when this happened i would have to completely power off my computer and restart it.,[]
although i do believe that windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.,[]
"great os, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.",[]
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything.,[]
that includes transferring my music and movies.,[]
"took that one home, same thing.",[]
i'm going back to pc.,[]
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.,[]
"we have had numerous problems with vista, such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.",[]
the dell mini was the first dell product that i had ever purchased.,[]
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.,[]
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.,[]
"one more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4gb stick of ram to save you $10",[]
"by week two, my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much.",[]
and it is impossible to get them back in.,[]
my last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new.,[]
i have been a mac user since the mid 90s.,[]
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!,[]
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq.,[]
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.,[]
it's solid.,[]
"before i got my macbook, i owned a dell laptop.",[]
"until i bought the dell, i thought you just looked for what you wanted (size, software, options, hardware) and purchase the best deal you could find.",[]
i don't know how i could ever live without my qousmio.,[]
"it lasted for many years of travel, kids and abuse and if i fired it up today, it would work.",[]
"been a pc user for many, many years.",[]
"i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it.",[]
"it freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it.",[]
"it is not even a year old yet, so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone.",[]
"i don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so i can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field.",[]
i'm very impressed.,[]
dell sucks,[]
it is easy to go from one keyboard to another.,[]
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!,[]
"i run dreamweaver, final cut pro 7, photoshop, safari, firefox, msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.",[]
i have owned many computers and laptops.,[]
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it!,[]
ive had to call tech support many times.,[]
"yes, i have it on the highest available setting.",[]
not to mention it has shit gigs.,[]
hieroglyphics are quite common.,[]
"i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen, as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners.",[]
"its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.",[]
i was so happy with my new mac.,[]
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.,[]
first it burned or fused the power adapter plug.,[]
"it was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.",[]
i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning.,[]
hp said i had done the damage.,[]
"if i had to buy another computer, i would most definetly buy an acer one computer.",[]
"though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to (cs5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.",[]
i previously owned an hp desktop and a dell laptop.,[]
everything else just install and go.,[]
this thing is a lemon.,[]
my laptop is almost 2yrs old and i have never had any problems with it.,[]
all the customers that come in hate dell.,[]
"we now own two of these, identical.",[]
i've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye'd the computer when i took it out of my bag.,[]
"i enjoy very much my new toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.",[]
"once you go mac, you can't go back!",[]
"they're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.",[]
"i let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.",[]
"if that is the case for you, i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases.",[]
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges.,[]
"i had to call apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.",[]
"no temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because ""many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset""-inquired status of repair.",[]
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.,[]
i respond that i do not have the old computer...,[]
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat.,[]
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there.,[]
"it is very durable, i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.",[]
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to louisville ky.,[]
i'm now trying to decide on another dell model.,[]
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would.,[]
"i believe this is because i was more active than the average user, meaning i average about three ""tabs"".",[]
best buy rocks!,[]
a couple things you should know:,[]
"bought the first asus laptop in san francisco, returned it in santa maria, thinking it was just a problem with that computer.",[]
all the yada-yada.,[]
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.,[]
""" this isn't a big deal, i haven't noticed the issue with dvds or other media, only through usb output.",[]
i love it!,[]
with windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must.,[]
but if you're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc.,[]
"i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp, but i use the touchpad 90% of the time.",[]
"when calling dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.",[]
two of the times was in one month.,[]
"so needless to day, i'm not happy.",[]
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.,[]
"although i was promised about 10 hours, i found myself to a limited 7 hours (which is still amazing).",[]
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.,[]
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me.,[]
"typically, when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience.",[]
consumer report recommended toshiba.,[]
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up!,[]
"the only thing that can be updated is the video, other than that you're all set.",[]
it wasn't worth it.,[]
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.,[]
probbly the worst decision we ever made!,[]
i had less problems.,[]
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan.,[]
of course my warranty runs out next month.,[]
my next laptop will also be a mac!,[]
but not in this case.,[]
"taking notes, research, an online class and such and didn't want to spend too much on my first machine.",[]
"when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, i had a hard time from beginning.",[]
i do not know for sure.,[]
every single one we've gotten we've had problems with.,[]
"(if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it shouldn't, check the ""activity monitor"" app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero.",[]
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash.,[]
return it.,[]
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase!,[]
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer.,[]
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company.,[]
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.,[]
that was a big mistake.,[]
"small enough to use on a long flight, light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.",[]
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus!!!,[]
"it has many great programs, such as ilife, iphotos and others.",[]
other thoughts: received replacement 16 days later.,[]
"if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication, hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note.",[]
"the processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.",[]
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated.,[]
might not make the avid gamer happy but i don't really think that is what this computer is designed for.,[]
"even though it is running snow leopard, 2.4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel.",[]
seriously why haven't they just replaced it by now.,[]
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.,[]
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.,[]
"i was originally concerned that i couldn't view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting, but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs.",[]
"it is a big big, but since it has a 18.4"" screen what would you expect!",[]
i have never had an experience like this.,[]
we haven't had any problems with it at all.,[]
returned it to walmart.,[]
i love everything about it.,[]
it's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else.,[]
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.,[]
all was well.,[]
he said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue.,[]
not worth it one bit.,[]
i just can't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs.,[]
much of which hp ended up paying for.,[]
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.,[]
"first of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty i'd paid almost $400 for, and i had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.",[]
"i hate to say this, but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then i would.",[]
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.,[]
"being only 2 months old, i am not a happy camper!",[]
"they would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.",[]
"such as pages, numbers, and so on.",[]
my laptop now has no battery.,[]
10 plus hours of battery...,[]
i'm going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible.,[]
the mac version of microsoft office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well.,[]
"the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.",[]
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.,[]
i loved it.,[]
"if anything, i would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to.",[]
i sit down and use my husband's work pc and i don't like it one bit.,[]
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.,[]
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.,[]
i like it better than my big dell laptop.,[]
"the flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x.",[]
"i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one, but imo no stars",[]
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer service agents for those who live in the united states.,[]
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.,[]
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.,[]
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop.,[]
it seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like i thought they would.,[]
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.,[]
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i don't run accross a situation like this again!,[]
i also experience the same with my macbook air.,[]
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.,[]
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life.,[]
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop.,[]
tons of bloatware and junk programs.,[]
"luckily, dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one, but instead i got a refund and bought a mac.",[]
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.,[]
never been hacked.,[]
it's so bad that i'm thinking i only got half a battery or something.,[]
i think it was seventy nine plus tax.,[]
"in summary, take your money elsewhere.",[]
"i will never buy (refurbished) again, i don't cae how cheap it is.",[]
it is just slow slow slow.,[]
"as a lifelong windows user, i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac.",[]
"so, owing to these problems, i went out and got myself an apple macbook pro, which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment.",[]
so this was great for me.,[]
this is the first macbook i have ever had.,[]
another problem.,[]
my only problem is i can not reg. the product key.,[]
"the ""time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.",[]
pay attention to the specs if you want these options.,[]
"stupidly, mind-numbingly slow--then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb *maximum*.",[]
it also does not have bluetooth.,[]
i can do pretty much 75% of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table.,[]
being a pc user my whole life....,[]
"during that time, i had to send it back 3 times.",[]
"although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro, this thing holds its own.",[]
i left the place angrily.,[]
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well!,[]
i've had a toshiba laptop in the past;,[]
asus said my net-book was working properly.,[]
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.,[]
very annoying.,[]
my main reason to convert was the imovie program.,[]
"if you need an affordable, entry-level laptop, this will fit the bill.",[]
it may take a little getting used to but you don't have to worry about viruses or other headaches.,[]
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!,[]
received the product promptly and without any issues.,[]
"it is so great, i can hardly ever take my hands off it!",[]
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused.,[]
"i got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so i was now on the second motherboard within 3 months.",[]
but reasons we chose this apple computer.,[]
"they say it could be the motherboard again, but dell",[]
by air sounds more like by truck to me.,[]
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped.,[]
it's outstanding too.,[]
so i'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.,[]
"a month later, we reinstall the os (vista).",[]
"some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.",[]
just chill and enjoy.,[]
it is her first laptop and she is thrilled.,[]
i should have sent it back to them then.,[]
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc's.,[]
"i don't have stupid pop up windows (even when i have pop ups blocked), i don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down.",[]
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room;,[]
don't waste your money or time.,[]
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here.,[]
"well, i bought this laptop a month or two ago.",[]
received all four in good order;,[]
the only pro to this computer is it was under $600!,[]
moral of the story:-do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.,[]
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring dell because it's a big name but they are a piece of garbage.,[]
not with apple.,[]
each time taking about 1 day or so.,[]
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.,[]
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.,[]
"so a couple of years later, i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet.",[]
probably won't work either.,[]
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase.,[]
"in my line of work, i often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.",[]
"they told me to reprogram the computer, and i didn't need to do that, and i lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life.",[]
"i use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.",[]
i bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his christmas present.,[]
it took so much time.,[]
i hate it.,[]
i'll stick to tashiba.,[]
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection.,[]
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this!,[]
i was said it's videocard.,[]
plus stylish.,[]
"and, if you are going to deal with hp be careful.",[]
i took the computer into best buy where i purchased it and they kept it over night to study it.,[]
"if your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer.",[]
my macbook pro is no exception.,[]
"unless you don't care how long it takes to get going, find something else.",[]
(you may be reading one now!,[]
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.,[]
"in fact, he said, about 10% of their products fail.",[]
this is the first apple product that i have purchased.,[]
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it.,[]
enough said.,[]
"setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.",[]
it had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.,[]
i do not plan on going back.,[]
"we were occasional mac users before, but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford.",[]
"called tech support and got the usual acer ""we don't support software but for $$$ we can help you"" i explained there was no software involved in booting.",[]
i would never tell anyone to buy one either.,[]
"the only thing i didn't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc.",[]
i can't say enough good for it!,[]
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks.,[]
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.,[]
just for a stupid cd.,[]
"it crashes, and when it goes flat, it just dies (like a pc, maybe worse) and i loose all my open documents!",[]
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.,[]
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well.,[]
i'v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.,[]
this just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!,[]
""" then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it wasn't like that.",[]
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.,[]
what a mistake!,[]
i had read online that some users were having sound problems.,[]
"my last computer, a toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.",[]
"three years is a decent life, but this must make it to graduation and beyond.",[]
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college.,[]
then it ceased charging at all.,[]
"i am not much of a computer techie, so i can understand some of the internal problems, though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program.",[]
stay away from hp.,[]
i like it!,[]
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him.,[]
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.,[]
its still going.,[]
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future.,[]
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.,[]
"prior to this computer, i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop).",[]
the advantages of owning 'a 'mac are numerous.,[]
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.,[]
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.,[]
"on the twelfth day that i had the notebook, i decided to go to dell's website and update it.",[]
the computer blinks it shuts off at will.,[]
"i have vista, so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs.",[]
"i can do everything i could before, only faster and more efficiently.",[]
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.,[]
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.,[]
i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble.,[]
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.,[]
"despite the plethora of problems, i managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years.",[]
"i first purchased this dell model ""1764"" on april 6, 201",[]
two times with in one month.,[]
"waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.",[]
"for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an itouch 8gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).",[]
"whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows (or winblows, as i like ot call it).",[]
but there's this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows.,[]
"if it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.",[]
") i also purchased applecare for $300, which is a three year extended warranty, since i ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two.",[]
"i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of, like my cad programs.",[]
"c'mon, lg.",[]
"whenever i call dell about an unrelated problem, they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if i'd like to purchase more memory for $75.",[]
"if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing, all craziness may break loose.",[]
registration/1st use is easy.,[]
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.,[]
take your time and go through the tutorials patiently.,[]
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it...,[]
"(i'm an excellent touch typist, and my hands are very sensitive, too.",[]
eventually we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the machine that was causing the problems.,[]
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.,[]
"i bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;",[]
"when i got it, i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive.",[]
"it is sleek, smooth, and lightweight.",[]
it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.,[]
they only stay charged a little over an hour.,[]
now they are believers in the product.,[]
i had never owned a mac before;,[]
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.,[]
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months.,[]
"returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage (keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in), buttons not working and usb ports inoperative.",[]
"when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service, on my eee pc i get 3 bars.",[]
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.,[]
the letter a stopped working after the first week.,[]
"by the time i was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without my computer for almost a week while i was an online college student, so it was very inconvenient and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also.",[]
it out performs any other laptop on the market today.,[]
this is what i call a good after sales service.,[]
"maybe it's acer, maybe it's msft.",[]
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.,[]
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could.,[]
tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.,[]
"i have never had it crash, randomly turn off,",[]
however the frozen screens kept happening.,[]
ive owned apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember.,[]
at least those computers didn't just die on me like this one.,[]
it's a mac!!,[]
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months.,[]
this is my first lg product.,[]
"it is short on space, and downloads always had problems being completed, or were said to be 'corrupted'.",[]
i'm going back to dell.,[]
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it.,[]
i went to my local best buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke.,[]
this a starter notebook.,[]
no i am generous calling it slow.,[]
"i have had at least eight toshiba laptops, and they have been outstanding, including this one.",[]
"i called back to ensure that received it, they had.",[]
"if you can afford a new laptop, and are in the market for one, of course, then definitely go for this.",[]
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.,[]
"now, the next issue i had freaked me out.",[]
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;,[]
"even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if, since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it's ""like new,"" i might have 8 months next time.",[]
i got this laptop on black friday.,[]
they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.,[]
i fell in love with it.,[]
"it was just one problem after another for me, and that's reason we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.",[]
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.,[]
maybe not the cutting edge (satellite l455d) but it is a workhorse.,[]
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it.,[]
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....,[]
my wife also has problems with her asus - different model.,[]
"features such as the dashboard (allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator, weather forecast, movie times, calendar, computer post its etc.",[]
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.,[]
"bought from wal-mart, i believe that this laptop was a repaired item.",[]
couldnt not use it.,[]
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.,[]
"i previously purchased a 13"" macbook (had pro specs and was aluminum style) which had a nvidia 9800 (if i am not mistaken) and it had major heating issues.",[]
they didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.,[]
we used pc products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing.,[]
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.,[]
i take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.,[]
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.,[]
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.,[]
i am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one.,[]
"they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not what i've done.",[]
"about 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.",[]
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good.,[]
"they went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.",[]
"*4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-annoyed at machouse amsterdam, decided to send complaint email to apple.",[]
"while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down, this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i've used.",[]
bought with a credit card.,[]
"i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, i took it for granted that these features were standard.",[]
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this toshiba was the best one for me.,[]
""" i've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it.",[]
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.,[]
"oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.",[]
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.,[]
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children.,[]
i did not take the class and wish that i would have.,[]
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.,[]
not good for a person who gets online daily.,[]
the laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed.,[]
"i can't even remember how i finally got it taken care of, but i was done with sony after that!",[]
so it was only about 2 weeks ago.,[]
"we carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the lcd just ""slide"" downwards.",[]
there is nothing better.,[]
i now own another hewlitt packard.,[]
"it is known as safari, and if you are doing any website work, you should know that many hosting companies do not support it.",[]
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.,[]
i have used a couple of others on the job as well.,[]
"posted nov 8, 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this notebook.",[]
acer won't replace the laptop.,[]
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating.,[]
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet!,[]
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using the mac.,[]
"this is the first laptop i've owned, althougth i used several at my previous job.",[]
"those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall? yeah, i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.",[]
i don't really have a complaint.,[]
i'm pretty sure it's not newegg's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop.,[]
best buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer.,[]
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there.,[]
"i claim that this has no value to me, the laptop was new anyway.",[]
enough said.,[]
not working = bad,[]
my son said it popped up and he clicked update.,[]
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening.,[]
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.,[]
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome!,[]
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.,[]
"the second issue i had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating, even if on for less than an hour!",[]
good luck with your purchase options.,[]
"buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac.",[]
very disappointed!,[]
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.,[]
i looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here.,[]
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.,[]
unless you need the bluetooth 3.,[]
i was sorly disapointed to discover that hp (what i thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.,[]
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically.,[]
no viruses.,[]
it is everything that i would want in a computer.,[]
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.,[]
"however, if i sound enthusiastic about this, i am!",[]
you will fall in love with it in no time.,[]
they removed them and returned the computer to me.,[]
"on 3 july 2004, i purcased this model at best buy for about $150",[]
i went with him and we picked this one.,[]
this is my second macbook pro and it's better than ever.,[]
the notebook would not turn back on again.,[]
"-when battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair (26th of august).",[]
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs.,[]
"it's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 watt lightbulb.",[]
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use.,[]
"mom, dad, brother, sister, you name it!",[]
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.,[]
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid.,[]
"u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.",[]
it's the most wonderful thing in the entire world.,[]
"so i'd pop them off to see what the problem was, well guess what? the darn thing wouldn't go back on.",[]
they sent out a sony 'certified' technician.,[]
getting the apple care plan is a must.,[]
"i've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new macbook pro.",[]
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.,[]
-apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days i send them the old computer.,[]
"so far, i have no complaints.",[]
his was worth $36.,[]
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops.,[]
"i spent 2200 dollars on a ""top of the line laptop"".",[]
i also own an hp notebook and it doesn't even come close.,[]
our apple 13.3 macbook pro notebook computer (z0j80001) notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.,[]
"i am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.",[]
"the dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.",[]
"as a die-hard windows enthusiast, i shunned the idea of a mac until this point.",[]
i think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.,[]
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.,[]
"i had a macbook notebook, and it had absolutely no protection from viruses, spyware, malware, etc.",[]
"the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did, and i have all of the programs that were on my pc.",[]
i made the right decision.,[]
"in the past few years, i've had terrible experiences with hp.",[]
"overall, it's ok.",[]
i am very happy!,[]
"as with any laptop not purchased with software options, it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications.",[]
i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems.,[]
i sent it back and they lost it.,[]
"do you think i purposely ""destroy"" my netbook, so that i can demand a new set? do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? or rather no solution.",[]
i'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3 months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to last).,[]
ok first.,[]
another satisfied customer.,[]
highly recommended!,[]
"the cool thing about the mac book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iphone, then i came back and put them onto my macbook and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip.",[]
"for two months, when you guessed it.",[]
this was my first macbook purchase ever.,[]
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day.,[]
or the cursor would show up some place else.,[]
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers.,[]
"as it turns out, i just didn't know any better.",[]
i've had friends with acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems.,[]
what can i say.,[]
what's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it doesn't keep what i put here are my aratings,[]
"it might be something deep within windows, for i was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.",[]
i had a toshiba for 10 years.,[]
"now i had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.",[]
"first, you ll discover that the word processing program known as appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.",[]
she can't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system.,[]
it doesn't bother me though.,[]
i've had this laptop for about a month now.,[]
i already have a hp laptop i bought last year that's standard size.,[]
it was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again.,[]
english must have been his third or fourth language.,[]
i am just one of the million customers.,[]
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.,[]
"love the graphics, awesome programs (including garageband), and really cool default background.",[]
i am taking back today.,[]
"my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.",[]
"-complied to their protocol, called number, made ""case"", got an email address to send complaint.",[]
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it!,[]
it quit working within a weeks time.,[]
but after i got used to it i love it.,[]
"i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to microsoft office).",[]
"after 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.",[]
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.,[]
they are closed at 9pm eastern.,[]
"in those three years, i've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily.",[]
"although my model was listed as recalled, hp denied my claim.",[]
it was secure and easy to navigate.,[]
"i was a little weary at purchasing another 13"" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.",[]
the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv.,[]
i am loyal to apple.,[]
i will be patient for few months.,[]
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet.,[]
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised.,[]
finally set the unit back to hp after a month of hell.,[]
"i couldn't afford a new mac, so i bought a pc instead.",[]
it was always getting froze up.,[]
"my information was all lost (my fault, i know, but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac, the paragon of all computers!",[]
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website!!!,[]
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it.,[]
this is the third macbook pro in our family.,[]
"i had of course bought a 3 year warranty, so i sent it in to be replaced and (almost 2 months later) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement.",[]
"apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.",[]
despite the claims of the apple apologists (a vice of which i am recently myself reformed) the internals of mac laptops are no different from pcs' at this point.,[]
"i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery dvds, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.",[]
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.,[]
"otherwise, all other features are a 1",[]
"so in late march, early april 2009 i was without it again for a couple weeks while i had online courses i had to complete and my fiance was in afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.",[]
i pondered very long over this decision.,[]
this thing sucks!,[]
"okay, let's just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy.",[]
it was a waste of money from day one!,[]
i'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration.,[]
but in fact it is totally the opposite.,[]
"he left me, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......",[]
it's a joke.,[]
"actually, i had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!",[]
i started hainv problems with it within the first month.,[]
"next, most acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.",[]
"i'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!",[]
but i don't see it as a problem.,[]
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to hp.,[]
i think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed.,[]
this one has had the same effect.,[]
so buyer beware when buying toshiba,[]
i found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal!,[]
i got my macbook pro because i wanted to do all the stuff i need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.,[]
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.,[]
"they're absolutely useless, unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall.",[]
was a great deal i will give that.,[]
"theres also idvd, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.",[]
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba? probably not ever again.,[]
"if what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.",[]
"-apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.",[]
"it doesn't have a lot of frills, but i didn't need any, and being able to buy what i needed, and not more than i needed was very important.",[]
i am sorry that i purchased this laptop.,[]
i am a college student and it has been very useful.,[]
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best.,[]
"i needed a new computer for graduate school (had never owned a laptop before), and the only reason i didn't purchase a mac was because my school's website strongly recommended students purchase pcs.",[]
"i have had another mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.",[]
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7.,[]
"it is, however, very heavy.",[]
"was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued, apparently because of known motherboard problems.",[]
"but, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.",[]
all you have to do is turn it on and it works.,[]
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect.,[]
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me.,[]
save your money and go for a better device.,[]
"i have been a pc user since middle school, but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side, or should i say the brighter side of life.",[]
"purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.",[]
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.,[]
my first problem was with the pre-loaded norton firewall/security program.,[]
"accordingly, i have decided to never purchase another hp product (my five year old compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.",[]
i ordered four d620 laptops.,[]
"i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that best buy offers).",[]
"i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.",[]
i was psyched.,[]
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.,[]
"not too much ""junk"" software to remove.",[]
system is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.,[]
"only issue is that it is a little slow, and i'm fixing that by adding more ram.",[]
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access.,[]
"if i have a few hundred dollars to spare, i'd buy the pro line though, the 2.53 and 2.66 ghz model.",[]
"but enough about that, i am an apple convert for life.",[]
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky!!,[]
"help, help, other than that gets a great little wonder.",[]
now i know!,[]
"after 2 months of complaints, asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies.",[]
"even set at the highest level, the computer sacrifices its queen every time.",[]
"that included the extra sony sonic stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer i got (that was worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the docking port.",[]
"my macbook pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.",[]
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote.,[]
i can't begin to say how disappointed i am.,[]
"it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.",[]
"easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.",[]
"take the simple, easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.",[]
it is as good as new.,[]
"i went from bestbuy to dell, windows to apple.",[]
back then my entire family was devoted to the sony name.,[]
"when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.",[]
love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.,[]
*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-visited machouse amsterdam.,[]
"they don't seem to be susceptible to viruses, which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers.",[]
i was very excited because this was my first personal computer and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents.,[]
asked the customer service rep.,[]
"so, i took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.",[]
basic computer.,[]
i fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all.,[]
it turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by wal mart.,[]
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.,[]
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.,[]
i should have bought one a long time ago.,[]
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.,[]
i got what i paid for.,[]
"just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute, but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card.",[]
"needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side, in the way of operating a mouse in small area.",[]
however i dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then i have ever had with anything.,[]
"i got the first ""blue screen of death"" in the early part of july.",[]
"-4 ram slots, 2 hdd bays*, 16gb ram support -no wireless issues, at least for me.",[]
"in fact, somehow (and i never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.",[]
it seems to be incompatible with everything else.,[]
"the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.",[]
when i took it back to best buy i asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane!,[]
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.,[]
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.,[]
it was returned on the third day i owned it.,[]
"it want take it, it keep saying error.",[]
"anyone who is considering buying an acer computer of any sort, i seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand.",[]
highly recommend for daily use.,[]
we are addicted to the mac.,[]

"after doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15"" mbp i5.",[]
i am addicted to photo booth!,[]
"so, i went back.",[]
"i like it so much, i bought another just for my wife.",[]
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one.,[]
hard disk - the new editions gives you more hard disk space (500gb instead of 320gb) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.,[]
"i don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time.",[]
"i considered i may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.",[]
guess i'll stay away from hp.,[]
"it was about six months later when the overheating problem started again, to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine!",[]
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all.,[]
and i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop.,[]
"but then, something goes wrong.",[]
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.,[]
"i saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what i know now,i would not buy it at that price.",[]
the local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some toshiba satellite.,[]
it has had some problems.,[]
"theres always something wrong with it, wether it be some virus you can't track down, or it overheats, sometimes even catches on fire, you just can't use it.",[]
they also use two totally different operating systems.,[]
they are about the same size keys.,[]
i'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.,[]
"i waited another month for approval and for them to ""build"" me a new laptop.",[]
this ain't it.,[]
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.,[]
again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!,[]
"finally, i couldn't take it anymore and ordered my apple.",[]
"i should have kept my big, old hp.",[]
"i am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.",[]
"you know, using the computer should be fun, not aggrevation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.",[]
you just get a trial version either way.,[]
i'm all for saving money but dell needs to step it up.,[]
there are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a windows computer.,[]
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.,[]
you pay for what you get for.,[]
"while about 8 years ago, i hope that the quality has changed.",[]
no more lenovo for me.,[]
"i also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.",[]
i am a full mac convert now.,[]
"though you get a polite person, you often don t get a solution.",[]
-i propose that i can just swap the hard drives.,[]
it was old but it was not till we bought the dell did we realize how great it was.,[]
"i initially purchased my macbook pro 13"" in april, and i loved it.",[]
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.,[]
the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early specifications for vista requirements from microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.,[]
go for it!,[]
"after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses, a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route.",[]
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty.,[]
perfect trifecta!,[]
it was a huge monstrosity of a laptop!,[]
-i propose that they can just swap the hard drives.,[]
so don't get it.,[]
it was a tough choice.,[]
every driver on the drivers/applications dvd is everything you will need for a reload.,[]
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new.,[]
the awesomest of the awesomest.,[]
"one, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).",[]
i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac.,[]
"i'm glad it waited, this one is great.",[]
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.,[]
"(for those old enough to remember, it is similar to beta versus vhs.",[]
"if so, you may be having similar problems.",[]
"some days it's just blurry, some days it appears that it's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains.",[]
this is my first personal satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous satellite work issued laptops.,[]
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original mac.,[]
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba.,[]
i can see why the have soooo much money.,[]
summary: hp knew they were shipping out bad bios and did nothing proactive to resolve it.,[]
"and in 6 months, there have been no freezing up and no blue, purple, black or any other type of screen.",[]
i had 3 months when the ports started going out.,[]
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.,[]
i'll wait and save up for a new one.,[]
they are not.,[]
"it makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze, and organizing them by place, time taken, or sending them to an online print shop, or uploading them to flickr or facebook etc, is not hard at all.",[]
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.,[]
i bought it to use in college and it is perfect.,[]
many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.,[]
"it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs, but now that i have, i can't see myself going back to it.",[]
they discovered the manufacturer's defect and sent it in for repair.,[]
love it love it love it!,[]
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv.,[]
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.,[]
this is not best buy's fault.,[]
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident (long story).,[]
"most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.",[]
i've had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it!,[]
"exactly that, users.",[]
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one.,[]
they will not let you down.,[]
"almost 4 years ago i bought what was then the current, up to date hp pavilion--if i recall correctly, it was the dv 1300 t.",[]
"it's not a recommendation, it' a plea.",[]
"in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they ""expedited"" the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a ""senior tech"".",[]
"-when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them, i tried to call.",[]
"i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but i rather have a hard copy.",[]
"got another 1, and same issue.",[]
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too!,[]
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.,[]
adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.,[]
i would never buy a dell again.,[]
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.,[]
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.,[]
"the rep did not even answer my question, i had to ask him, if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.",[]
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows laptop!,[]
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc.,[]
they don't crash.,[]
"this notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.",[]
i love this little one.,[]
so not having my laptop was discouraging.,[]
"i fine apple mc373ll/a 2.66ghz 15"" macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.",[]
again i sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside.,[]
"fully charged, the macbook pro can last about five hours unplugged.",[]
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing.,[]
"1st hand experience is very important, especially for a new customer.",[]
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!,[]
"however, this will be my last as well.",[]
"there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when i click on it it says: "" consider replacing your battery"" and it does not hold full charge.",[]
"so? how can you solve it? c'mon, i just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago.",[]
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork.,[]
the first programm i switched on was a game for my children.,[]
i have had my macbook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not a mac.,[]
i've always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what it's all about.,[]
on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.,[]
it came alot faster than i thought it would have which was really exciting.,[]
"then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.",[]
but if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.,[]
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills .,[]
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased.,[]
"they respond: ""your dissatisfaction is noted""...",[]
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.,[]
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection).,[]
"i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased.",[]
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.,[]
(3dmark6 score is only 8500).,[]
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba.,[]
"so honestly, i wasn't expecting anything less than perfection, and i wasn't disappointed.",[]
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines.,[]
my friends are in awe every time they come over!,[]
little short on ram but you get what you pay for.,[]
"the first one i had was a 2006 model, not the pro.",[]
"then, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.",[]
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection.,[]
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.,[]
"i work in film editing and post production, so i need a laptop that not only has power, but memory and speed as well.",[]
"i took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the ""blue screen of death"".",[]
"it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted, but i didn't realize at the time it would be such a monster!",[]
"even doing so, the hinge may just be slightly tightened only.",[]
this is what a laptop is supposed to be.,[]
"then i've fixed the dc jack (inside the unit), rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.",[]
i purchased two laptops (for my husband and 16 year old daughter).,[]
more relieved than anything.,[]
summary: spend your money elsewhere,[]
believe me apple has a reputation.,[]
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.,[]
"pc users work in word, while mac users work in pages.",[]
"i am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.",[]
"while i mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, i'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard i've come to appreciate from mac laptops.",[]
i've been having endless problems since i bought the computer - only 1 month ago,[]
"so far, it's an average laptop - no better, no worse than the hp i replaced.",[]
i wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp laptop.,[]
i was starting to boil.,[]
hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.,[]
back she goes!,[]
"it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.",[]
not the day received.,[]
good for every day computing and web browsing.,[]
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.,[]
if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it!,[]
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.,[]
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.,[]
i've had my macbook pro since august 2009.,[]
took a while to clean it up to my specs.,[]
they are so realistic i am just speechless.,[]
"this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years, i find not much difference except of course for the screen size.",[]
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.,[]
they have more problems then a 1980's computer.,[]
it is amazing.,[]
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it.,[]
my first laptop was an acer that i got for christmas.,[]
"the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but i have just been using firefox instead.",[]
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.,[]
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.,[]
i did not have to call the support line at all.,[]
"but if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.",[]
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can't be used with the ibook.,[]
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba.,[]
don't waste your money!,[]
currently if i use the laptop i can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.,[]
-managed to send complaint email.,[]
"however, they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge.",[]
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell,[]
"i do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.",[]
i thought it would be a simple job.,[]
i hate it!,[]
i can leave my macbook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it won't even be dead.,[]
"i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology, downloading pictures and graphic design.",[]
i'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.,[]
"i love this 13"" mac white unibody.",[]
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!,[]
when i am at starbucks between clients i get full bars on my hp and 1 bar on my eee pc.,[]
and inconvenient!,[]
many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.,[]
i will never purchase a hp again ever.,[]
"it bluescreened on me without any warning, running simply basic chrome.",[]
this is another reason to like the mac.,[]
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops.,[]
one bad thing is it gets hot.,[]
hope this helps!,[]
but guess what? (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) the notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.,[]
apparently they're not special anymore .,[]
i use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.,[]
i'm so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc!!!,[]
99 to fix it.,[]
few viruses to catch;,[]
"because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.",[]
"it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, ""74%, plugged in, not charging""), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.",[]
"info: windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.",[]
most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.,[]
"we didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!",[]
"i use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp, well, i'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone!",[]
they claim call center is still down.,[]
mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.,[]
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.,[]
my house is now 100% macbook.,[]
"they're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.",[]
"my husband uses it mostly for games, email and music.",[]
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem.,[]
i just took the broken cords into the apple store and they gave me new ones.,[]
my mac is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.,[]
you just lose a customer.,[]
"i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.",[]
"apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.",[]
"being a pc user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i'm finding my way around.",[]
"i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and ""fixed"" the edges by rounding them off.",[]
i hate it!,[]
returned it.,[]
it is a cheap throw together.,[]
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.,[]
"i would recommend mac, and do, to anyone looking to buy a new computer.",[]
can't wait until i go on vacation and take it with me.,[]
i had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.,[]
"so, after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.",[]
"once again, i was told it was the suspicious power supply problem.",[]
"it was kind of a rebellion against pc in fact, and i am certainly glad i did.",[]
unable to boot up this brand new laptop.,[]
"i actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they finally agreed to replace it, (all of this in less than 1 1/2 years!",[]
"i really don't like it, but i am stuck.",[]
"the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the ""repair"".",[]
"the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.",[]
-stay away from machouse amsterdam.,[]
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts.,[]
these new problems were the final straws;,[]
"luckly i had a student task force able to help, or else it would have crashed within the first year.",[]
"that seemed to solve the problem, till i wrote an article with semicolons in it.",[]
-touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to.,[]
we both recently got new laptops.,[]
i've been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back.,[]
i got the macbook and he got a macbook pro.,[]
winters is on it's way and i imagine it will be cozy.,[]
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop.,[]
will certainly use macconnection again.,[]
"but, buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram (2x2gb for $92 or 1x4gb for $99), and save yourself $100 than the other model with 8gb of ram.",[]
this is one of the reasons i purchased it.,[]
"instead of taking another chance on toshiba, i went with an asus g73jh-x3.",[]
"she told me flatly, ""it's like that one.",[]
"so you might ask, what did apple do for me?",[]
"browsing, also, was no problem for me when i used itunes ( which usually slows down my pc ).",[]
should be there by the end of the week (again...).,[]
"my friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like i will have to as well.",[]
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.,[]
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $250 loss.,[]
i was wrong!,[]
so this review might be a tad bit bias.,[]
"this was around three years, maybe four years ago.",[]
this is a review of windows vista system.,[]
she said its very user friendly.,[]
"cosmetically, the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top.",[]
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on.,[]
there's literally no way to make it sing with vista.,[]
"after looking at all the pros and cons, i decided on the macbook pro.",[]
"first, it does not have a push button to open the lid.",[]
hope this helped!,[]
"i used to build my own desktops from the component parts, and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working (this was a rock star 7 years ago).",[]
i now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a windows laptop.,[]
"please, anyone who is considering getting this computer, stop.",[]
) and printing from either word processor is an adventure.,[]
very satisfied.,[]
do not buy it!,[]
-estimated time to fix it: 10 working days or less.,[]
"after purchasing this thing, i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.",[]
i had my computer custom built from sonystyle.com.,[]
another included program that is laughable is the chess game.,[]
"yes, i thought the expese was a little much, but i now realize you get what you pay for.",[]
i will not buy another one.,[]
time will tell.,[]
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would have taken the class.,[]
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going.,[]
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.,[]
one of the wonderful things about macs is that they are virus free.,[]
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely cannot be without.,[]
"i practically have a new laptop with all the ""fixes"" they have done!",[]
"finally, i purchased a toshiba.",[]
you may just lose 1 customer for now.,[]
"my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan.",[]
"many thanks, overstock.com.",[]
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it.,[]
")only to get another ""hp/compaq"" piece of crap.",[]
emachines says they're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit.,[]
"the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.",[]
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.,[]
i've always used pc's for work home and this is my first experience with a mac.,[]
"i asked many people, search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy.",[]
"startup in about 30 seconds, shutdown in 2-4 seconds, resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds.",[]
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april.,[]
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to.,[]
i was so excited to receive the toshiba l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine!,[]
i had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .,[]
"summary: after doing some investigation on the web, i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting.",[]
"i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses, without results.",[]
you know what? i happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the bukit batok polyclinic nhg pharmacy a week ago.,[]
the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn't work in real time.,[]
everything was so easy.,[]
"to list a few: they tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns, as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up.",[]
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college.,[]
"after 5 months of failed repairs, requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and acer is indifferent to the issue.",[]
"after years of using pcs, a new mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer.",[]
you better believe my next computer will be a mac!,[]
i love it!,[]
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more.,[]
"after numerous calls to applecare tech support, i was directed to send in my computer;",[]
"the ""abuse"" is that i pushed the power plug in too hard.",[]
"it is easy to find documents, and keep them in one area.",[]
"with all the programs that came with it, such as ilife and iwork, i was set from the very beginning.",[]
"i go to purchase it on line, and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later!",[]
dell is a decently made pc.,[]
best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks.,[]
i would have to say that overall its great!,[]
"there are no gold key numbers too intall programs, you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time.",[]
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.,[]
it's the inside that is truly wonderful.,[]
i purchased this laptop 9 months ago!,[]
which is great i am running vista business and scored a 5.x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5's.,[]
returning this as soon as i get out of work,[]
"i use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers.",[]
this unit is not.,[]
"either way the entire thing was just a joke, a complete rip off!",[]
so glad i decided to upgrade!,[]
it's catatonic.,[]
"i have never really been big on downloading anything so i wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus i thought i was protected by norton.",[]
"he came into my house, fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it.",[]
"my wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine, and any connections i turn on should work.",[]
"i upgraded it's ram to 2gb, i am very happy with it.",[]
i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 (with harman/kardon speakers!) in december of 2005.,[]
dismantle the whole thing? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before.,[]
they should have included more memory on their computers if they knew vista would run slowly.,[]
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it.,[]
i paid $800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore.,[]
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses!,[]
"i was very worried about making the two compatible- but literally, it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong.",[]
note that i don't ordinarily take the time to write a review.,[]
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.,[]
buyer beware.,[]
"so i called compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which i shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.",[]
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.,[]
do not buy you will be disappointed.,[]
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair.,[]
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months!,[]
we don't mind and you don't matter.,[]
"also, i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.",[]
"waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.",[]
the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.,[]
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my pc.,[]
enjoy your sitdown,[]
"another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad, keys, and casing.",[]
i have had my new macbook pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc laptops.,[]
see when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.,[]
"the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16"" laptop does.",[]
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.,[]
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.,[]
at first it's like you're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop.,[]
i can use it for all of my needs.,[]
"after doing cad work all day at work, using a higher end pc, i couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.",[]
either way i'm furious.,[]
"my laptop cost approximately $2,300 and died after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.",[]
i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash.,[]
"this computer was bought because i wanted ""top of the line"", fast, reliable, ha.",[]
a lot of help they weren't!,[]
(the sata controller is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive.),[]
i will never buy anything from hp again!,[]
i can't imagine ever buying a pc again!,[]
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click.,[]
took it back as it was defective.,[]
"other thoughts: i love newegg, i recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable.",[]
now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.,[]
i simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus.,[]
"i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.",[]

"so far, so good!",[]
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.,[]

"the lesson learned here is: it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.",[]
pdf files can be viewed instantly.,[]
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it.,[]

"all of the programs (keynote, pages, numbers) have an option to save your documents as microsoft compatible, which really eliminates the need for the actual.",[]
"the best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google ""dell coupons"" you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price.",[]
"there is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.",[]
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $1000,[]
i can't honestly say i was heartbroken.,[]
will not every buy another--------lou,[]
and finally i realized that mac is the best.,[]
it's very annoying.,[]
i'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross.,[]
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot.,[]
i'm very disappointed in dell.,[]
i've only had mine a day but i'm already used to it...,[]
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.,[]

i have recently converted back to a mac and i couldn't be happier!,[]

at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.,[]
they basically told me that the machine would be problem free now.,[]
i paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.,[]
you can call hp and they want you to buy more software to fix it.,[]
it has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on.,[]
it's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.,[]
"i'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and apple does, indeed, have the better idea.",[]

taking it anywhere was a pain!,[]
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.,[]
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years.,[]
i can't imagine my life without it anymore!,[]
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.,[]
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2 quad running at 2.83 ghz.,[]
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it.,[]
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.,[]

even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.,[]
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it.,[]
"it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs, using the internet, and doing other things everyone does on a computer.",[]
not even safe mode boots.,[]
which was way too much money.,[]
"to those thinking about switching, do it and do not look back!",[]
"this is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.",[]
i had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.,[]
1.you can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does not support that function).,[]
"took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different fedex offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it support technicians in the world.",[]
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.,[]
"one year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it.",[]
"as usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (i could see them).",[]
it all just makes sense.,[]
2) blue screen first month,[]

the two of us use it regularly.,[]
very happy with my 7th toshiba laptop!,[]
my wife recently purchased an apple macbook pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday.,[]
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine.,[]
i will only buy apple laptops from now on.,[]
it did not have all the features i expected it to have.,[]
just a bunch of idiots who's english as a 5th language is forced at best.,[]
"no luck, although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).",[]
"i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!",[]
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything.,[]
5) cut my losses and sold it for parts,[]
all i can say is w-o-w.,[]
"which is what i did, check out my acer 5517!",[]

i've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.,[]
"i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a ""different"" computer.",[]
"so far, so good.",[]
even out of warranty!,[]
this comes in very handy for me as an educator.,[]
it's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.,[]

you will regret it if you buy any dell.,[]
it started out getting hot after only a few months.,[]
"i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.",[]
it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more.,[]
"the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.",[]
", which apple doesn't offer, is why i bought my macbook at best buy.",[]
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.,[]
i'm glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac.,[]
because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.,[]
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.,[]
