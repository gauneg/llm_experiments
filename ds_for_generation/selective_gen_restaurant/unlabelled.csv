we won't go to this place again for a good meal.,[],0.61317736
it's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.,[],0.561551

"after dinner, take your date to the huge dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in ny.",[],0.37921092

but the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,[],0.3184497
"i had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.",[],0.51612777
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.,[],0.53328794

"first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...",[],0.4538442
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square.,[],0.30357984
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.,[],0.43833888
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!,[],0.2524838
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.,[],0.5052555
"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.",[],0.43859667
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.,[],0.43165734
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.,[],0.4593237
i absolutely love this place!!!,[],0.43641287
"when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",[],0.3284006
