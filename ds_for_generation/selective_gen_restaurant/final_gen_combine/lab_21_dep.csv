i found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.,[]
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read.,[]
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.,[]
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.,"[('city', None), ('restaurant', None)]"
"the food is consistently wonderful - i've been coming here for years, and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly.","[('owner', None), ('food', None)]"
"the food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.",[]
"for those that go once and don't enjoy it, all i can say is that they just don't get it.",[]
"not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great.",[]
"it took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!",[]
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.,[]
"he can't help, they're bought up so fast.",[]
"secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.",[]
"i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.",[]
obviously run by folks who know a pie.,[]
we were very disappointed.,[]
it is definitely special and affordable.,[]
i really liked this place.,[]
i will be going back very soon.,[]
"all the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.",[]
"i asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.",[]
it was pretty inexpensive too.,[]
will not be back.,[]
"don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.",[]
my suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.,[]
look foward to trying the ruben upon returning.,[]
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.,[]
you'll adore it.,[]
two words: free wine.,[]
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store.,[]
"i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a. being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.",[]
"three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.",[]
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.,[]
at the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.,[]
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.,[]
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.,[]
"whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.",[]
this is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.,[]
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends!,[]
not what i wanted to hear.,[]
try the lasagnette appetizer.,[]
"i've been there a few times, and i usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.",[]
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.,[]
can't wait to go back.,[]
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds.,[]
"if you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been.",[]
one thing i liked about this place is that i never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.,[]
this place is a great bargain.,[]
we happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.,[]
deff recimmend bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.,[]
we always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.,[]
"dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat.",[]
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace.,[]
"my husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.",[]
"everyone i have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer.",[]
sapphire is the only indian restaurant i go to when i'm in nyc.,[]
i heartily recommend.,[]
all my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.,[]
"we ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.",[]
"this place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps queens' biggest secret!",[]
this place is so much fun.,[]
i was glad i did.,[]
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.,[]
i've never been treated so rudely.,[]
i'll be back soon.,[]
went inside and i started to get excited.,[]
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.,[]
our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.,[]
"however, it is jus too good to not praise it.",[]
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.,[]
it's somewhere you can eat and be happy.,[]
"if you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what rao's is all about.",[]
"had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!",[]
but overall i give it a 10,[]
"i have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.",[]
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).,[]
"an oasis of refinement: food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.",[]
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.,[]
some baby pizzas get their wish.,[]
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someone's living room.,[]
i was there on sat.,[]
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it,[]
the last time i went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen.,[]
"nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale italian decor.",[]
what more can you ask for?,[]
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.,[]
they have authentic indian at amazin prices.,[]
you are treated just like royality.,[]
"there's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).",[]
ambiance- relaxed and stylish.,[]
"yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.",[]
"looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).",[]
i look forward to eating here again,[]
i know because i live nearby.,[]
my entire family was horrified.,[]
on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out.,[]
"for great chinese food nearby, you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away.",[]
"this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant, the food.",[]
hats off to the chef.,[]
this should have been done in a back room - away from customers.,[]
glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.,[]
check it out,[]
don't go.,[]
but they do.,[]
look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (please try someother places).,[]
"our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.",[]
"ambiance and music funky, which i enjoy.",[]
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.,[]
"it's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.",[]
went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).,[]
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend.,[]
"i am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.",[]
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.,[]
enjoy!,[]
we weren't!,[]
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.,[]
(la rosa is connected by a swinging door to the mexican restaurant pacifico).,[]
the other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if i could of licked the plate clean i would of.,[]
please be aware that it's cash or amex only!,[]
it's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.,[]
i had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.,[]
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.,[]
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.,[]
"so i've never actually been to m proper, but i've had it delivered a few times.",[]
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.,[]
"a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.",[]
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.,[]
nice family owned traditional restaurant.,[]
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it.,[]
we were very pleasantly surprised.,[]
i will never visit this restaurant again.,[]
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.,[]
"(or sister, in my case!).",[]
i've eaten at many different indian restaurants.,[]
"they might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says i love you.",[]
try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant.,[]
don't go there!,[]
"ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.",[]
good luck getting a table.,[]
"we picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.",[]
don't look down your nose at me like that...,[]
just don't do it.,[]
"the takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, i can't wait!",[]
"trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.",[]
my girlfiends and i ate at o.g. again last night.,[]
i wish they had one near my office- i would go everyday.,[]
finally!,[]
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes.,[]
you will not be disapointed at all.,[]
they didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.,[]
"word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.",[]
open late (well as late as i ever got there and i'm a night person),[]
"the most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.",[]
"get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.",[]
"everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.",[]
something about them being busy with holiday party's.,[]
the sake menu should not be overlooked!,[]
i would highly recommend.,[]
this place is great.,[]
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.,[]
"with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!",[]
"went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed.",[]
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.,[]
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of nyc.,[]
we visit at least once a month.,[]
"also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.",[]
i'll keep this short.,[]
"however, it's not worth a special trip.",[]
and it was quick which is very important.,[]
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.,[]
"but, nothing stands out about the cooking.",[]
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.,[]
i've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.,[]
"i had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.",[]
always busy but fast moving.,[]
too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.,[]
"the food was really good, i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.",[]
i'm not picky - but it was actually gross.,[]
"overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.",[]
"since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.",[]
"based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for dim sum again.",[]
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.,[]
despite the untasteful previous review...,[]
"don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.",[]
"sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know sal, is to know new york.",[]
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.,[]
also they were $15 each!,[]
"my friends spoke so much about it for months, i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.",[]
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.,[]
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.,[]
"if you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!",[]
"you order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.",[]
we will go back every time we are in the city.,[]
we love th pink pony.,[]
so eat fast and order a lot.,[]
i have to agree with the previous reviewer.,[]
"if you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.",[]
i went to del frisco's friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.,[]
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me.,[]
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.,[]
you can't go wrong with this place.,[]
"we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.",[]
authentic bistro!,[]
"they are tasty, but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system.",[]
"it's true, this place is not cheap.",[]
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.,[]
it's convenient.,[]
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip.,[]
"oh right, i should probably say something nice.",[]
"odd for ave b, not just odd, the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.",[]
instead of wasting your time here: support restaurants that care about food.,[]
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions.,[]
"the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).",[]
as we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.,[]
perhaps.,[]
go here.,[]
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave.,[]
"especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.",[]
"my wife and i always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.",[]
what a great place.,[]
"by the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.",[]
"read all the other review, they'll confirm it.",[]
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there.,[]
"he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.",[]
"great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.",[]
"when you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.",[]
i have been twice to this restaurant.,[]
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.,[]
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros.,[]
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.,[]
it's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.,[]
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.,[]
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.,[]
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.,[]
"we could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.",[]
fantastic place.,[]
definitely not a restaurant to skip!,[]
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.,[]
usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.,[]
"while certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.",[]
"the place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.",[]
what a ripoff!,[]
threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier.,[]
you can do it here.,[]
"may, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.",[]
i've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all.,[]
i just read mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.,[]
the sides were ok and incredibly salty.,[]
it hits the spot every time,[]
"for some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon.",[]
"not a large place, but it's cute and cozy.",[]
don't be fooled by crowds of people.,[]
and there's no way out.,[]
"please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.",[]
"when going out for a nice dinner, i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.",[]
"for all you lazy folks that don't want to come to alphabet city, i say, good - stay out.",[]
"this is my fourth try over a two year period, and i'm done.",[]
probably would not go again...,[]
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner.,[]
we go on mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to blue ribbon.,[]
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.,[]
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc.,[]
"also good for client lunch meetings, esp.",[]
it was horrible.,[]
the desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced french restaurants.,[]
"i found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish i had.",[]
"the new york times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.",[]
i have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.,[]
i came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged.,[]
"a cheap eat for nyc, but not for dosa.",[]
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.,[]
"the seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.",[]
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.,[]
"($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).",[]
"really though, where's the seasoning?",[]
"by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!",[]
"solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.",[]
"we didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.",[]
"otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.",[]
"the dinner was ok, nothing i would have again.",[]
it is thick and slightly soggy.,[]
its not the same if you have to sit inside.,[]
"i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....",[]
great people watching as others do the same to you.,[]
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but i've experienced the same with other restaurants so i don't appreciate such practice.,[]
"two people in our party felt like something else, and volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.",[]
"the waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.",[]
i'm going back.,[]
my friends and i have been going here regularly for two years.,[]
me and my girls will definitely go back.,[]
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.,[]
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.,[]
all the food was hot tasty.,[]
have been several times and it never dissapoints.,[]
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.,[]
would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.,[]
while i'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!,[]
this place was not all that!,[]
"first of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by citysearch's editorial review.",[]
"the second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.",[]
others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.,[]
why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?,[]
i do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.,[]
highly recommended!!!!!,[]
this is the best thing in soho.,[]
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.,[]
"for $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.",[]
"while the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in new york city, there is definitely better food in that range, and so sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return.",[]
i had been searching really hard for a restaurant in new york where i could really feel unwanted and ignored and i finally found it!,[]
it's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.,[]
wonderful at holiday time.,[]
the place is a lot of fun.,[]
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.,[]
"as we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.",[]
"the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.",[]
"in fact, two people could really share one plate.",[]
this was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.,[]
during happy hour!,[]
good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.,[]
"go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it.",[]
i am bringing my whole family back next time.,[]
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.,[]
a guaranteeed delight!,[]
i have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.,[]
overall i would recommend it and go back again.,[]
"anyway, this is the last time i cross the williamsburg.",[]
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.,[]
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.,[]
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.,[]
"besides, we were on vacation!",[]
i love this cozy around the way rest.,[]
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!,[]
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city.,[]
"the place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.",[]
raga stands out with an interesting fusion of french and indian cooking.,[]
"oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.",[]
the food options rule.,[]
a great choice at any cost and a great deal.,[]
"anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.",[]
"we ate here in march, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.",[]
definately check it out!!!,[]
"probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).",[]
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.,[]
"saturday, nov. 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us.",[]
"first, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which i would have chosen had i known about them.",[]
we will be back.,[]
"also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.",[]
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.,[]
check out the secret back room.,[]
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.,[]
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.,[]
also very inexpensive.,[]
"we've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.",[]
i got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!,[]
"my husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.",[]
you cannot go wrong with this place.,[]
"it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner.",[]
"the combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in ny.",[]
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently.,[]
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?,[]
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.,[]
both the fresh mozzerella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal.,[]
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.,[]
"unfortunately, the food was not something to get worked up about.",[]
"it's constantly open, catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).",[]
"i went at 6:00 pm specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.",[]
go inside and you won't want to leave.,[]
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get.,[]
"the large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.",[]
"while this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.",[]
the owner truly caters to all your needs.,[]
he takes real pride in his food and his business.,[]
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent.,[]
i would go back tho.,[]
"the photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.",[]
too large for just two people but nothing was left.,[]
a pleasant surprise.,[]
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!,[]
we got most of it back at home with us.,[]
"if this happens, just ask for real naan.",[]
"so, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, i would say try it.",[]
definitely a neighborhood favorite.,[]
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.,[]
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.,[]
there are other people waiting!,[]
ou must try this restaurant.,[]
"we left, never to return.",[]
"this place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc (and i'm indian, so i should know).",[]
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently.,[]
this is where the aforementioned line was.,[]
"aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, will smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....",[]
we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.,[]
i dont how this place is still running.,[]
we were in search of food and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street.,[]
"well worth the trip, close to city hall and downtown subway stops.",[]
what more could you want?,[]
"if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.",[]
"all in all, i don't see how you can go wrong.",[]
"my husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.",[]
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.,[]
i'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.,[]
what a great place!,[]
"still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...",[]
"food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).",[]
"although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.",[]
"even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.",[]
"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.",[]
was surprisingly disappointed.,[]
i'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.,[]
"i haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.",[]
"the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.",[]
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.,[]
it's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.,[]
"behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.",[]
"if only they delivered, they'd make a mint!",[]
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.,[]
"despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.",[]
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.,[]
"in any event, this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town.",[]
i definitely wouldn't go back.,[]
it is not worth for that bucks.,[]
"growing up in ny, i have eaten my share of bagels.",[]
a hearty two thumbs up!,[]
"all the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!",[]
"besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.",[]
all pretty good.,[]
"you can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.",[]
you guys rock.,[]
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.,[]
be careful before you request extra spice.,[]
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two.,[]
tends to turn people away.,[]
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.,[]
"i was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.",[]
it's delicious!,[]
"if you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!",[]
"meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.",[]
i never had anything i didn't like here.,[]
it won't break the bank but i also wouldnt come back for the food.,[]
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!,[]
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects.,[]
"if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).",[]
"no refills on fountain drinks, though.",[]
wow over 100 beers to choose from.,[]
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.,[]
great for large groups and celebrations - our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening.,[]
did i mention the wine?,[]
"plus, on wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!",[]
now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.,[]
even my indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.,[]
less = more in their case.,[]
i've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.,[]
i've been many time and have never been disappointed.,[]
"however, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.",[]
we won't go to this place again for a good meal.,[]
it's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.,[]
we were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!,[]
"after dinner, take your date to the huge dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in ny.",[]
has the chef and owner changed???,[]
i absolutely loved this place.,[]
i wish i lived there as i would eat at this place as often as possible!,[]
"pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!",[]
"if you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.",[]
"i found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.",[]
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food!,[]
"best italian food i ever had (and being italian, that means alot).",[]
located at the end of a magnificent block.,[]
"this restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.",[]
"looking around, i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.",[]
they don't walk around with the trays of dim sum.,[]
took my sister here before attending a show one evening.,[]
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.,[]
really.,[]
our friends have not arrived yet.,[]
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.,[]
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,[]
"i had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.",[]
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.,[]
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i don't have to deal with crowds or lines.,[]
"after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.",[]
wouldn't recomend it for dinner!,[]
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.,[]
"first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...",[]
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square.,[]
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.,[]
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!,[]
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.,[]
"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.",[]
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.,[]
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.,[]
i absolutely love this place!!!,[]
"when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",[]
there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.,[]
no thanks!!!,[]
"there was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.",[]
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.,[]
i love this place!,[]
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.,[]
"a big disappointment, all around.",[]
and its absolutely delicious.,[]
no free drink.,[]
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,[]
definitely highly not recommended.,[]
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.,[]
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.,[]
"go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!",[]
i'd call it an 'italian dinner'.,[]
"while the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.",[]
i have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.,[]
have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.,[]
i pray it stays open forever.,[]
"if you want to save some money, don't go here.",[]
"i had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, i'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).",[]
this is the first time citysearch did't call it right.,[]
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst.,[]
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city.,[]
what for?,[]
fantastic!,[]
highly recommended for a first date.,[]
"we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, i feel.",[]
skip this location and go to the one in soho.,[]
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there.,[]
"i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.",[]
"i need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!",[]
"all of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty and best of all it didn't break the bank.",[]
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza like vt's.,[]
the place was quiet and delightful.,[]
molto bene!,[]
.the best i've found outside of the chinatown masters.,[]
they are amazing!,[]
avoid this place!,[]
the food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.,[]
a must try!,[]
"as much as i like the food there, i can't bring myself to go back.",[]
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.,[]
it is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in nyc with a week's notice.,[]
i have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.,[]
"based on a visit a month ago, i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed.",[]
went here on a friend's reccomendation.,[]
"nha trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.",[]
we will definitely go back.,[]
is just the way it was in days gone by.,[]
"if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in nyc.",[]
"having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.",[]
"the owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!",[]
"it can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.",[]
"the bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.",[]
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful.,[]
you must try the shrimp appetizers.,[]
"my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy,s food is expensive but it's new york!",[]
"it's like you are transported to the italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.",[]
just go and see for yourself.,[]
i hate this.,[]
any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.,[]
the food at this place is 'gourmet' indian cuisine.,[]
get over it!,[]
"however, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.",[]
"however, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked perrrrrrrrrfect.",[]
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight.,[]
"if you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.",[]
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.,[]
"while it's not nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.",[]
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.,[]
it's very spicy but not offensive.,[]
i don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.,[]
they used shredded cheese on top!,[]
they are located in the middle of chinatown!,[]
check it out.,[]
"i am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.",[]
i would go again if i didn't have to pay.,[]
my friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (and look like).,[]
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i don't have to rush off to a show.,[]
"hopefully next time, i will save room for dessert.",[]
"not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner.",[]
go here.,[]
"the best chicken pad tai, i've ever had.",[]
we weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.,[]
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.,[]
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it .,[]
over 100 different choices to create your own.,[]
"very romantic fires - i've literally spent hours at lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience.",[]
"i almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and i could have all the dumplings to myself!",[]
"after reading the posts, i was always skeptical to go to the minnow, despite living in park slope.",[]
i loved it and will be back soon.,[]
"always a nice crowd, but never loud.",[]
"my turkey burger was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw.",[]
this isn't your corner chinese food takeout.,[]
"my husband and i ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,",[]
"try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!",[]
"told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.",[]
just awsome.,[]
i recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!,[]
this place is incredibly tiny.,[]
"i will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!",[]
this is one of our all-time favorite.,[]
in reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.,[]
this place is amazingly bad.,[]
i love this place.,[]
the people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.,[]
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.,[]
made my dining experience uncomfortable.,[]
it's a steal!,[]
"still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer...",[]
i was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.,[]
what's the difference between the two?,[]
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!,[]
"good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz' deli, or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.",[]
i was very disappointed with this restaurant.,[]
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh.,[]
i'm glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny.,[]
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.,[]
not a small feat for good french food in the area.,[]
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment.,[]
will never be back.,[]
"the entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.",[]
i highly recommend it.,[]
oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.,[]
my six year old loved it.,[]
i'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.,[]
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location.,[]
"thr at moshphere is compact, modern, yet cozy.",[]
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.,[]
"the food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.",[]
"worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.",[]
too cold to enjoy.,[]
i brought some buddies from ca and they loved it.,[]
"inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.",[]
"during our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.",[]
"but they don't have a toaster, which is strange.",[]
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.,[]
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.,[]
"if you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go.",[]
i'm sure i'll return for a final judgement tho.,[]
"of course, it is crowded but who cares.",[]
"from the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.",[]
hmmm.,[]
"it was nice and fresh, but i can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.",[]
"overall, worht every penny.",[]
"when i called this morning, i didn't think i would be able to get in at 12, but i was able to get in, along with four other guests.",[]
"got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.",[]
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build.,[]
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.,[]
i haven't been to the other locations.,[]
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.,[]
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.,[]
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.,[]
"it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.",[]
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here.,[]
it's one of our favorite places to eat in ny.,[]
"the place does get crowded, so i recommend going between 4-5 pm.",[]
"i'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant i recommend going.",[]
this lovely french-asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street.,[]
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.,[]
but i'd go back,[]
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting.,[]
"great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.",[]
i try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.,[]
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.,[]
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.,[]
i don't think i would go again.,[]
we were a group of 8 and well seved.,[]
and that's no mean feat...,[]
i often go there to eat with my family.,[]
i wish they would change back to what it was before.,[]
"the signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese.",[]
no pizza 33 for me!,[]
"i'm no food critic, but i'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years.",[]
i noted it was crossed off on the bill.,[]
"needless to say, i'm never going back and you should be wary too.",[]
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.,[]
i went here with my boyfriend and another couple.,[]
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.,[]
"that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.",[]
they were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,[]
first it took us a long time to find the place.,[]
"it is about food and ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.",[]
"immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.",[]
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!,[]
"admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us.",[]
"once you become a regular, you are treated as one.",[]
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.,[]
everyone treats you like you were part of the family.,[]
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.,[]
the menu is nothing like the one on the website.,[]
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.,[]
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly.,[]
oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant arties cafe.,[]
(besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).,[]
my roommate and i love this place.,[]
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan.,[]
not worth it.,[]
"in the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, ny crowd.",[]
"so close, but not good enough.",[]
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (i happen to live in inwood).,[]
the food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.,[]
"don't waste your time, or money!!",[]
"they don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.",[]
"we couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.",[]
this was a great surprise.,[]
"after complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.",[]
it was wonderful.,[]
went for a late weekday lunch.,[]
"although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.",[]
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.,[]
i don't get it either.,[]
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.,[]
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.,[]
"it's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).",[]
"they brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.",[]
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.,[]
i for one will never patronize them again.,[]
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood.,[]
"after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.",[]
"so, again, give it a try.",[]
stay far away from this place.,[]
we will come back!!!,[]
we've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.,[]
we'd go back again,[]
this food is asian-air fusion.,[]
"while i quite liked the food and the ambience, i'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.",[]
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience.,[]
"i have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews i got take out last week.",[]
once for dinner and once for brunch.,[]
would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.,[]
i only have friends.,[]
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal,[]
"being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago.",[]
please save yourself the frustration.,[]
and i say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.,[]
"i have eaten at saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.",[]
"if your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in time sq...",[]
"we were on our way back to nj, and since i am in ny, we figured why not grab some food?",[]
and comparing it to the chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.,[]
every course was better than the next.,[]
"not cheap, but not that expensive either.",[]
"apparently, the good cook works then.",[]
i was pleasantly suprised.,[]
everyone is welcomed in as family.,[]
"the menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.",[]
"spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet.",[]
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.,[]
"hey, i think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.",[]
look elsewhere.,[]
everyone i bring here always loves it.,[]
worth a visit.,[]
a real dissapointment.,[]
its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.,[]
why do people rave about the ambience.,[]
they charge $6.00 for rice.,[]
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.,[]
"try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.",[]
"from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.",[]
i will be going back and heartily recommend it!,[]
would definitely visit again.,[]
"perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.",[]
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened.,[]
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.,[]
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.,[]
so i thought why not change it up a bit.,[]
p.s. please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.,[]
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.,[]
"to celebrate a birthday, three of us went to mare anticipating great food.",[]
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!,[]
"i went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.",[]
great atmoshere and worth every bit.,[]
we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.,[]
"only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, i'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!",[]
i went there with my friend last saturday.,[]
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.,[]
just an odd group.,[]
"either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.",[]
i love this place!,[]
it is not consistent.,[]
"be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.",[]
"fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions.",[]
"drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.",[]
the one vegetarian entree (abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.,[]
"at 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.",[]
"and the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!",[]
"even better, they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.",[]
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc.,[]
good drink.,[]
was there friday night.,[]
we had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week.,[]
romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).,[]
"however, i was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from london noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.",[]
i recommend it!,[]
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well.,[]
enough said!,[]
i don't live in ny but my best friend does.,[]
"we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.",[]
after the review i treked into brooklyn.,[]
we were pleasantly greeted.,[]
when we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.,[]
"yeah, it's that good.",[]
"if you love seafood, you would love this place!",[]
they charge different prices all the time.,[]
"my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at artisanal last night.",[]
"i am so coming back here again, as much as i can.",[]
i have been going back again and again.,[]
"it's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.",[]
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine.,[]
"in terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.",[]
"overall, excellent restaurant!",[]
"to begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.",[]
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly i might add).,[]
i ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!,[]
"don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.",[]
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.,[]
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.,[]
but too far east!,[]
satisfying.,[]
highly highly highly recommended!,[]
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.,[]
"no dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy midtown.",[]
even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in new york pizza restaurants).,[]
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.,[]
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv.,[]
now if they could only get a toaster.,[]
you will find yourself returning quite often.,[]
"the ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe's.",[]
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.,[]
"this was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.",[]
it appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.,[]
i go twice a month!,[]
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai.,[]
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.,[]
"i only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most nyc italian joints i've tried similar dishes at.",[]
a million better places to go in the city.,[]
"if celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.",[]
i love it.,[]
"we had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.",[]
its located in greenewich village.,[]
three strikes and this restaurant is out.,[]
we bring in a party of ten or so every week.,[]
"so, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good.",[]
"overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.",[]
we would return to this place again!,[]
not enough wines by the glass either.,[]
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.,[]
"just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.",[]
"we were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.",[]
"everything i had was good, and i'm a eater.",[]
one should not go to lucky strike for the food.,[]
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue.,[]
"to me it exemplifies soho, cute, artsy, interesting.",[]
"try everything for that matter, it is all good.",[]
both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).,[]
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone.,[]
"night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.",[]
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.,[]
i agree.,[]
"last memorial day, i tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).",[]
"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.",[]
i have enjoyed everything i have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.,[]
i love to visit murrays for my bagel fix.,[]
"we made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.",[]
recommended.,[]
the place was nice and calm.,[]
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.,[]
i think locals rate this place so high.,[]
but they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).,[]
go girls!!!,[]
"they forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.",[]
old school meets new world.,[]
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.,[]
this is probably one of my new favorite places.,[]
"for being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.",[]
"for myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, i do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.",[]
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.,[]
they all know you.,[]
"my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.",[]
i've been several times and am totally smitten.,[]
i love the place.,[]
will have to return to try the chocolate!,[]
"it's only $1.95 for a regular slice and $4.00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms.",[]
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited.,[]
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors.,[]
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel.,[]
this one is definintely my least favorite.,[]
"everytime my husband and i go there, we are never disappointed.",[]
we were not disappointed.,[]
i've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.,[]
"$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.",[]
"its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.",[]
"we arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the past!",[]
the wine list is extensive and impressive.,[]
"when we left at 8:00 pm, it was packed and noisy.",[]
"okay, so i never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and it's time to speak up - i live in chinatown.",[]
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.,[]
never fails to please.,[]
will absolutely visit again.,[]
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll.. .,[]
this big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!,[]
we spent 50 $$ definetly will come back with my friends!!!,[]
went to village last night for my birthday.,[]
"some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.",[]
they've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.,[]
that's good and bad.,[]
the best burger i have had in the village.,[]
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $35 menu.,[]
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space.,[]
"came here for restaurant week, didn't save much, but it was still great.",[]
would never go back there.,[]
three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.,[]
"be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!",[]
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (anywhere).,[]
"only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.",[]
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.,[]
bring your appetites.,[]
for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.,[]
"like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.",[]
"seriously, this place kicks ass.",[]
the food is nothing like its menu description.,[]
i loved it and would highly recommend.,[]
i've been here twice now.,[]
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different.,[]
"however, i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.",[]
it's a small cute restaurant.,[]
i will be returning.,[]
restaurant was dirty and unkempt.,[]
nice place though.,[]
"similar to other indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.",[]
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!,[]
"the people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak english, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.",[]
"not the greatest sushi place, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat.",[]
"shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.",[]
what i didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.,[]
try it side by side and there's no comparison.,[]
i think i've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.,[]
"great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.",[]
"if we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.",[]
"the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.",[]
i would highly recommend it.,[]
it's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.,[]
lloovve this place.,[]
"you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting.",[]
"place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...",[]
went last thursday.,[]
i love this place more and more everytime i go.,[]
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.,[]
"we only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.",[]
"i have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch.",[]
we went to ino for valentines.,[]
"the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.",[]
"it was good, but was not what i thought it would be.",[]
"he always says, i don't have customers.",[]
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.,[]
"they never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.",[]
we had a good time.,[]
"also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...",[]
people are rude bit again it's new york!,[]
we all felt it was worth it.,[]
"the plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.",[]
"based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm.",[]
"you'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.",[]
came looking for this place because i heard good things.,[]
i live on the street this place is on.,[]
horrible.,[]
here's to the fake fish tanks too...,[]
what an amazing meal and experience!,[]
"the staff has always been attentive and kind, and i've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in.",[]
nothing special about this place.,[]
"also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.",[]
and never strayed.,[]
leave the kids at home!,[]
"this place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.",[]
and all of that won't break your bank!,[]
delicious.,[]
big thumbs up!,[]
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda.,[]
they even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.,[]
it's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.,[]
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.,[]
that's why you have to pay more for that.,[]
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.,[]
i loved it.,[]
but i wouldn't wanna live there.,[]
arigato gozimas yuka!,[]
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an orginal deli.,[]
i would highly recommend this place!,[]
"yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.",[]
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious).,[]
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction,[]
"(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) we got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.",[]
"the food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.",[]
"off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants.",[]
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive.,[]
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.,[]
i loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.,[]
zero ambiance to boot.,[]
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.,[]
as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.,[]
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.,[]
great neighborhood joint.,[]
my fiance took me to scopa last week for my birthday and i couldn't believe the food.,[]
i take all my nyc guests to vt's.,[]
"it is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's nyc!",[]
"good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.",[]
"we asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.",[]
"good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.",[]
"however, their popularity has yet to slow down, and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.",[]
"the place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and i got our food, the line reached the door.",[]
i am happy i did the food was awsome.,[]
"we ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.",[]
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.,[]
"i recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.",[]
i loved the shows.,[]
"and i have been around the block, to say the very least.",[]
"then, get ripped on free box wine.",[]
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.,[]
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere.,[]
"also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.",[]
give it a try and enjoy.,[]
...and that's saying a lot.,[]
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.,[]
"however, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!",[]
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.,[]
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!,[]
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.,[]
i go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.,[]
"obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong, it actually means great prosperity.",[]
i think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.,[]
"i have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.",[]
"when you want a piece of beef, head on over.",[]
"delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.",[]
"also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!",[]
unbelievable.,[]
"my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.",[]
this restaurant was way overhyped.,[]
i've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and i've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.,[]
i cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.,[]
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you.,[]
i thought i had died and gone to heaven.,[]
"not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again, i will certainly stop by.",[]
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.,[]
i have been going there since it opened and i can't get enough.,[]
"always popular, always full, always a wait.",[]
"in fact, you can't miss it.",[]
it is run by the same sichuan chef who started the chain in chinatown.,[]
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.,[]
"i can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.",[]
go here for the drinks!,[]
i'd definitely recommend this little place.,[]
"again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.",[]
"the first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.",[]
"butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.",[]
"it cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.",[]
get it together.,[]
"my entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.",[]
"in fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and i couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.",[]
"even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.",[]
"if you want americanized chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.",[]
"the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in chinese.",[]
"food is average, and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchi's tastes better.",[]
enjoy!!!,[]
my boyfriend and i were in ny for a few days and pastis was a place that came recommended.,[]
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday.,[]
"if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.",[]
never again!,[]
have the iced tea.,[]
for park avenue i expected so much more.,[]
"small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.",[]
so rude.,[]
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!,[]
they are fast.,[]
"very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.",[]
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.,[]
and i could do without the cigar smoke.,[]
"still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.",[]
i've waited over one hour for food.,[]
great deal!,[]
stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).,[]
"not only does make the best pizza in ny , maybe anywhere.",[]
our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.,[]
the place is a bistro which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.,[]
"overall, the ingredients and technique are there and i am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.",[]
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.,[]
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food (all fast foods in my opinion).,[]
we do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.,[]
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.,[]
i plan on stopping by next week as well.,[]
"compared to ess-a, tal offers a less doughy bagel!",[]
"as a retired hipster, i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.",[]
"then, if they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!",[]
they offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.,[]
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.,[]
highly recommended to all!,[]
highly recommended.,[]
"unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.",[]
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.,[]
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.,[]
"after the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes!",[]
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc.,[]
"when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.",[]
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken.,[]
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers i'd go out in manhattan.,[]
"after a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.",[]
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.,[]
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.,[]
always fresh and delicious.,[]
"this is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!",[]
had a late night dinner on a saturday night.,[]
bravissimo !!,[]
"when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.",[]
"this is the cheers of new york, whether you've ever been there or not.",[]
it's to die for!,[]
"i've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times, when i have been in the neighborhood.",[]
you will be satisfied.,[]
another great place to take out-of-towners!,[]
"but, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in astoria.",[]
we were less than impressed.,[]
but still my date was bad,[]
would definitely go back again.,[]
i have been to rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.,[]
(and i have eaten my share) which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.,[]
"had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was $55.00, not including tip.",[]
"it's really a takeaway place, i wouldn't sit if i could take it home.",[]
the most fun restaurant i have ever been too!,[]
slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.,[]
"nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.",[]
go for it!,[]
highly recommended.,[]
i cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.,[]
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.,[]
"to speak of the park side, words can not describe.",[]
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.,[]
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share.,[]
"it is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, do not pass it up.",[]
"i like cafe noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!",[]
but $1 for each small piece???,[]
"no food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.",[]
i liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.,[]
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant.,[]
not a great place for family or general dining.,[]
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).,[]
i was wrong.,[]
"so, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.",[]
no plans to return anytime soon.,[]
"seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- as everyone says, the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.",[]
there is not a single place in chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.,[]
"while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city, the food was not what i had hoped for.",[]
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine.,[]
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about.,[]
"we liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york.",[]
"but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the bts.",[]
for an untrendy rip-off- eat here.,[]
and you're hungry a few hours later.,[]
i can't wait to go back.,[]
i hate hate hate this place.,[]
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.,[]
monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.,[]
wonderful!,[]
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.,[]
go hungry and enjoy.,[]
i have eaten a lot of pizza here.,[]
this place is worth an one-hour drive.,[]
from the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that i can't remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.,[]
truly the mark of an attentive waiter.,[]
the food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.,[]
all i can say is wow!,[]
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.,[]
"sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.",[]
food was ok - fish was cooked well.,[]
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food.,[]
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!,[]
wont come back again for sure!,[]
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.,[]
"the place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.",[]
"after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.",[]
bon appettite!!,[]
"the food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.",[]
the food is authentic italian - delicious!,[]
skip dessert.,[]
we spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.,[]
it is simply amazing.,[]
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.,[]
i liked this place the first time but doubt i will ever return.,[]
it's all about the food !!,[]
"skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.",[]
"stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.",[]
always full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to rockefeller center).,[]
"bravo, blue hill!",[]
"conveniently located too, being right on bedford ave.",[]
my friends and i came across this place while walking in the village.,[]
this place is to be avoided.,[]
my sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.,[]
"we, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.",[]
"at 6:30, we were the third party there.",[]
i will definetly be going back.,[]
"no, really.",[]
i've been to naples 45 for dinner twice.,[]
i'm saving up for my next visit.,[]
their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.,[]
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.,[]
"believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.",[]
"worth it for a special occasion, or any time!",[]
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.,[]
"i had a late dinner at lucky stike, a great name for a joint if ever i saw one.",[]
"been there, done that, and new york, it's not that big a deal.",[]
definitely a once a year treat that i look forward to around the holidays!,[]
from an english speaking staff.,[]
"anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice.",[]
and they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!,[]
a defitely must visit.,[]
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full.,[]
"i went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.",[]
my friends and i showed up on a sat.,[]
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had (i tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).,[]
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes.,[]
"we love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!",[]
(i've ordered from the 2nd ave.,[]
"went on a 3 day oyster binge, with fish bringing up the closing, and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended, because it was so great!",[]
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.,[]
"if the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.",[]
"however, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.",[]
"i recommend their pad see ew, pork chops or tofu plates.",[]
never in my life did i think that i could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3.00 in nyc.,[]
"the main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.",[]
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.,[]
"just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.",[]
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular.,[]
the dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.,[]
i definitely will go back.,[]
finally!,[]
i've never been disappointed.,[]
i won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.,[]
"we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if i call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so i wouldn't have to look for parking).",[]
"from the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.",[]
my boyfriend and i have been to the minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.,[]
"i wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.",[]
"for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, i don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.",[]
simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.,[]
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out.,[]
"stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.",[]
"i've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times, but more often i order delivery.",[]
we didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.,[]
"if you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.",[]
"also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.",[]
"when my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have lobster tails ummmmm need i say more) i can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget if you never go, you'll miss a meal of your life time",[]
"in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.",[]
"oh yes, and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, i would love to know where they obtained.",[]
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.,[]
this is also where i was from.,[]
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.,[]
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.,[]
i have never had anything like it!,[]
"yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.",[]
and they provided a delicious dessert on the house!,[]
"they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.",[]
"i am indian, and i have tried many indian places in ny.",[]
"on a recent saturday night, i was with a group of 5 at the bread bar.",[]
"dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!",[]
"it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat.",[]
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food.,[]
"this is, by far, my favorite restaurant in nyc and i only wish it were more affordable so i could go more often!",[]
"we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, i felt there was more than enough food.",[]
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl.,[]
it was divine melts in your mouth.,[]
stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and i will be going back frequently.,[]
"when i visited my friend who lives in the upper eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.",[]
"warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).",[]
we ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.,[]
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.the,[]
i plan on eating here more often.,[]
"i would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine dining.",[]
i came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.,[]
"i would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not that great.",[]
"its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.",[]
"this is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.",[]
and we were thouroughly disapointed.,[]
this is the jackel and hideof the restaurants on the ues.,[]
"this is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.",[]
since my first dinner i have had the chance to have brunch at orsay 3x.,[]
they have some great entrees here as well.,[]
"our teenage kids love it, too.",[]
you guys are awesome!,[]
"they do cater to american palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!",[]
i loved this place!!,[]
i care more about the food and ambience.,[]
avoid at all costs.,[]
i would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!,[]
i recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon,[]
"great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...",[]
i would just ask for no oil next time.,[]
"while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way, the food was insultingly horrible.",[]
i really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central.,[]
i would not recommend this place to anyone.,[]
"they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!",[]
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested.,[]
"normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain.",[]
"perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.",[]
"southern indian cuisine is still there, too.",[]
"restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.",[]
they couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.,[]
this place is always packed.,[]
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.,[]
i am not sure if i would call the food here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch.,[]
"their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for purple haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!",[]
"the tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.",[]
"after dining at b.o.g over twenty times now, its official !",[]
"my husband and i both ordered the steak, medium.",[]
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine.,[]
owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.,[]
i would go back.,[]
definitely will be back!,[]
i'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much.,[]
"three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous.",[]
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected.,[]
"i live nearby and when they first opened, i ate there a lot.",[]
this is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.,[]
"if you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).",[]
"aside from the sea urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail, boton shrimp, blue fin torro (fatty tuna), sea eel, etc.",[]
"the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.",[]
"my host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.",[]
the bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.,[]
"during the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.",[]
we were exploring grand central and didn't want to eat in the food court.,[]
"overall, not worth the money.",[]
we left after one drink.,[]
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.,[]
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.,[]
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny--i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.,[]
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.,[]
"the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.",[]
i've been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and i've never been disappointed.,[]
the 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.,[]
"it was raining, and we figured why not?",[]
"$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.",[]
"just straight up cheap, good food.",[]
another welcome addition to the neighborhood.,[]
"this time, i prefer not to go into detail.",[]
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!,[]
and affordable.,[]
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.,[]
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.,[]
the staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.,[]
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores.,[]
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.,[]
it was a very nice surprise.,[]
i am french and i really felt like home!!!,[]
"it's usually packed for good reason, esp.",[]
i love going there!,[]
i cannot recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself.,[]
"it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york.",[]
"and, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.",[]
there was no ambiance.,[]
but trust me it is so worth it.,[]
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge.,[]
"the only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4, which makes no sense whatsoever.",[]
"they sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.",[]
do not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.,[]
they never came back to refill our glasses again.,[]
"i took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good meal.",[]
"they're rude at times, and not very friendly.",[]
i'm happy to have nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting.,[]
"good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on fridays.",[]
"they kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!",[]
love the food.,[]
it's a nice place to relax and have conversation.,[]
"going to volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook.",[]
i loved it and would go again.,[]
so so so so so good!,[]
"out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens, this is among the best.",[]
i keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table i can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.,[]
"it was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return.",[]
we go often.,[]
moral stay away.,[]
"when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli, i knew there was going to be good pizza!",[]
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.,[]
they're terrific!!,[]
"great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.",[]
just stick with the small dishes!,[]
"this place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers, right off of pell st (barber's alley) in chinatown.",[]
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.,[]
we were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.,[]
"if you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards.",[]
just wish they'd expand.,[]
"this wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but i thought that was what made the place so special.",[]
you can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown.,[]
"great eats, good times.",[]
make sure you try this place as often as you can.,[]
"plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!",[]
another plus is most of the entrees are approx.,[]
i will go back to suan soon!,[]
loved it!,[]
"the food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second!",[]
we were pleasantly surprised.,[]
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.,[]
"i am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and i was still hungry after my visit to this place!",[]
it was wonderful.,[]
will give it another chance before i write it off.,[]
the all-italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.,[]
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.,[]
it is the best hidden spot there and i rave about it to everyone.,[]
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table.,[]
can't wait wait for my next visit.,[]
this place is the most japanese it can ever get.,[]
"great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!",[]
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.,[]
this place is worth going even if only for their beer.,[]
stay away from this place.,[]
"while most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in new york bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.",[]
"complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.",[]
"the food arrived 20 minutes after i called, cold and soggy.",[]
"the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you, brother?",[]
brava la pizza fresca!,[]
"if you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, kai is your place.",[]
"check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.",[]
"if just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.",[]
i have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal.,[]
i go back in line like three times on average until i can't walk anymore.,[]
the wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.,[]
their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.,[]
"even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.",[]
we saw them heating up at least one frozen item though i'm not sure which dim sum dish it was.,[]
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.,[]
the fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).,[]
"consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.",[]
i really recommend the very simple unda (egg) rolls.,[]
i will not be coming here at 3am again.,[]
unbelievable.,[]
"this is the only thai place i go too in nyc, it's wonderful, and live relaxed jazz on certain nights.",[]
we will be back.,[]
"if you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here.",[]
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.,[]
and everytime i go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.,[]
"when we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.",[]
they need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.,[]
i've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait.,[]
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.,[]
"judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.",[]
"for appetizers, i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings.",[]
"the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible, reaching for sunglasses.",[]
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.,[]
amazing!,[]
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as i love la pizza fresca).,[]
i've always been seated propmtly.,[]
there is nothing more pleasant than that.,[]
i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again.,[]
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.,[]
our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.,[]
"sake collection was excellent (try nanbu bijin), but pricy.",[]
interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.,[]
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.,[]
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood.,[]
the place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.,[]
this is a true gem of the village.,[]
"they treat me like family, morning and night.",[]
a wonderful place!,[]
"please take my advice, go and try this place.",[]
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.,[]
i went to amma after a friend recommended it.,[]
i'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.,[]
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.,[]
maybe tomorrow ;-),[]
please don't fool us.,[]
i suspect this restaurant is what rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive.,[]
the dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.,[]
"strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.",[]
we were then shooed inside.,[]
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.,[]
"it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.",[]
this place is always very crowded and popular.,[]
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.,[]
my wife and i went to orsay for valentine's dinner.,[]
"i don't know about you guys, but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere.",[]
"a gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.",[]
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaraunts.,[]
"when you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.",[]
"we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.",[]
i've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.,[]
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.,[]
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too.,[]
and when i visit her i make it a point to eat at 'ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.,[]
"in fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.",[]
there was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at pastis.,[]
for meetball night.,[]
want to impress?,[]
we've lived in the area for more than 8 years.,[]
get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.,[]
i have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- i dont mind.,[]
my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.,[]
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.,[]
the restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must.,[]
a one women show!,[]
you can't go wrong here.,[]
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues.,[]
"to my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.",[]
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.,[]
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i've found little toninos.,[]
i thought this place was totally overrated.,[]
how do you rate home?,[]
i went here in the afternoon with a friend.,[]
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 10:15.,[]
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies.,[]
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.,[]
boy was i wrong!,[]
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke.,[]
"note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.",[]
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.,[]
ahhh...,[]
it helps if you know what to order.,[]
but that is highly forgivable.,[]
"from the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.",[]
"when we arrived at 6:00 pm, the restaurant was practically empty.",[]
"each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.",[]
i am going to the mid town location next.,[]
