bottles of wine are cheap and good.,[]
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an orginal deli.,[]
from the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that i can't remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.,[]
"besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.",[]

definitely a neighborhood favorite.,[]
this place was not all that!,[]
"if you want americanized chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.",[]
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different.,[]
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.,[]
the place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.,[]
"had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was $55.00, not including tip.",[]
"i am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and i was still hungry after my visit to this place!",[]
we do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.,[]
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.,[]

.the best i've found outside of the chinatown masters.,[]
i have been going there since it opened and i can't get enough.,[]
i felt as though i were eating in paris.,[]
great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).,[]

i'm glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny.,[]
definitely a once a year treat that i look forward to around the holidays!,[]
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.,[]
the food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.,[]
le pere pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.,[]
(always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer!!!,[]
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.,[]
also very inexpensive.,[]

however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town.,[]
i can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?,[]

look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (please try someother places).,[]
"very romantic fires - i've literally spent hours at lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience.",[]
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night.,[]
the big complaint: no toasting available.,[]
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i don't have to deal with crowds or lines.,[]
"stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.",[]
"based on a visit a month ago, i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed.",[]

i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine.,[]
"where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.",[]
ive been here so many times the waiters know my name.,[]
he takes real pride in his food and his business.,[]
great experience overall.,[]
the wine list is extensive and impressive.,[]
nothing special about this place.,[]
i was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!,[]
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.,[]
they charge $6.00 for rice.,[]
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.,[]
i've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste.,[]
do not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.,[]
overall a worthwhile experience.,[]
"after the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes!",[]
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.,[]
it's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.,[]
"its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.",[]
"the place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.",[]
"a large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.",[]

avoid this place!,[]
"compared to ess-a, tal offers a less doughy bagel!",[]
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too.,[]
very different than regular dimsum places.,[]
a little crowded but they move that line really fast!,[]
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.,[]

we did have to wait at the bar for approx.,[]

"upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, steven and frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.",[]
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.,[]
"it can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.",[]
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.,[]
just awsome.,[]
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday.,[]
priced at upper intermediate range.,[]
for park avenue i expected so much more.,[]
"however, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.",[]
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.,[]
was there friday night.,[]
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.,[]
"the restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.",[]
i'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.,[]
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (i happen to live in inwood).,[]
"my husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.",[]
excellent experience.,[]
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl.,[]
went here on a friend's reccomendation.,[]
"if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.",[]
"over the years the host, vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",[]
"to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate.",[]
"the only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4, which makes no sense whatsoever.",[]
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends!,[]
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.,[]
"for $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.",[]
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there.,[]
they are located in the middle of chinatown!,[]
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes.,[]
"it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.",[]
don't go there!,[]
my wife and i were in nyc celebrating our 30th anniversary.,[]
"i asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.",[]
it was horrible.,[]
you will be satisfied.,[]
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.,[]
"i wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.",[]
try it side by side and there's no comparison.,[]
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there.,[]
"there's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).",[]
"trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.",[]
"shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.",[]
"for all you lazy folks that don't want to come to alphabet city, i say, good - stay out.",[]
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.,[]
"it's also attached to angel's share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...",[]
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.,[]
went inside and i started to get excited.,[]
"inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.",[]
"the main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.",[]
"i wasn't there for the half-price saturday night special, but tuesday night.",[]
"so i've never actually been to m proper, but i've had it delivered a few times.",[]
"it is loud, hot and dark.",[]
"immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.",[]
the bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.,[]
that's good and bad.,[]
i went to amma after a friend recommended it.,[]
highly recommended.,[]
highly recommended.,[]
"they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.",[]
"when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",[]
"when you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.",[]
stay away from this place.,[]
wine list is not huge but def well selected.,[]
"sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know sal, is to know new york.",[]
"anyway, this is the last time i cross the williamsburg.",[]
satisfying.,[]
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.,[]
"it took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!",[]
two words: free wine.,[]
"this place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps queens' biggest secret!",[]
first it took us a long time to find the place.,[]
"in any event, this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town.",[]
"we only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.",[]
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there.,[]
"he always says, i don't have customers.",[]
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).,[]
"to begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.",[]
i'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.,[]
too bad latin quarters closed.,[]
good drink.,[]
"first of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by citysearch's editorial review.",[]
nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.,[]
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave.,[]
"the wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for chinatown) alternative.",[]
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues.,[]
good luck getting a table.,[]
"be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!",[]
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well.,[]
recommended.,[]
"don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.",[]
"well, this place is so ghetto its not even funny.",[]
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!,[]
"meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.",[]
"also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.",[]
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it .,[]
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get.,[]
"they're rude at times, and not very friendly.",[]
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!,[]
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.,[]
"whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite.",[]
it was a very nice surprise.,[]
suan was a recommendation that i am glad we heeded.,[]
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment.,[]
"you can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.",[]
this was a great surprise.,[]
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.,[]
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.,[]
"for being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.",[]
"not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again, i will certainly stop by.",[]
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,[]
try the times square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka.),[]
prices are in line.,[]
"my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.",[]
we got most of it back at home with us.,[]
this is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.,[]
wonderful!,[]
beautiful experience.,[]
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.,[]
was surprisingly disappointed.,[]
"recommendations, of course, are required!",[]
"however, it is jus too good to not praise it.",[]
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.,[]
i would go again if i didn't have to pay.,[]
i go twice a month!,[]
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke.,[]
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.,[]
"conveniently located too, being right on bedford ave.",[]
i will go back to suan soon!,[]
"we had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.",[]
i loved it and would go again.,[]
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.,[]
brava la pizza fresca!,[]
so sorry i can't rate this better.,[]
"to give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to ping's three weekends in a row!!!",[]
i was at rao's last wed.,[]
i ordered a lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.,[]
"my co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered.",[]
great people watching as others do the same to you.,[]
"but on a lazy saturday night, we ended up going.",[]
"la rosa waltzes in, and i think they are doing it the best.",[]
highly highly highly recommended!,[]
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.,[]
everyone is welcomed in as family.,[]
it was divine melts in your mouth.,[]
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.,[]
this was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.,[]
open late (well as late as i ever got there and i'm a night person),[]
"been there, done that, and new york, it's not that big a deal.",[]
fantastic!,[]
"having been a long time ess-a-bagel fan, i was surpised to find myself return time and time again to murray's.",[]
horrible.,[]
i have to agree with the previous reviewer.,[]
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.,[]
"as we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.",[]
i agree.,[]
"everytime i decide to try another place on the ues, i get angry that i didn't just go to zucchero pomodori.",[]
i have never had anything like it!,[]
i am bringing my whole family back next time.,[]
"we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.",[]
our friends have not arrived yet.,[]
deff recimmend bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.,[]
"fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.",[]
it is thick and slightly soggy.,[]
i dont how this place is still running.,[]
"they brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.",[]
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.,[]
"don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.",[]
obviously run by folks who know a pie.,[]
"some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.",[]
also they were $15 each!,[]
total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.,[]
"again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.",[]
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip.,[]
we were not disappointed.,[]
why do people rave about the ambience.,[]
i've always been seated propmtly.,[]
here's to the fake fish tanks too...,[]
tends to turn people away.,[]
definately check it out!!!,[]
"since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.",[]
i loved it.,[]
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.,[]
fish was overdone.,[]
"always popular, always full, always a wait.",[]
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.,[]
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.,[]
"their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for purple haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!",[]
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv.,[]
"if presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works.",[]
this is one of our all-time favorite.,[]
really cool stauff inside.,[]
i love it.,[]
every course was better than the next.,[]
"however, their popularity has yet to slow down, and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.",[]
"for those that go once and don't enjoy it, all i can say is that they just don't get it.",[]
people are rude bit again it's new york!,[]
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.,[]
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.,[]
the fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.,[]
check out the secret back room.,[]
"not cheap, but not that expensive either.",[]
great find!!!,[]
we left after one drink.,[]
"a glass of leaping lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.",[]
"our teenage kids love it, too.",[]
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.,[]
"to my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.",[]
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.,[]
it's a steal!,[]
lloovve this place.,[]
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build.,[]
for two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.,[]
can't wait to go back.,[]
i am going to the mid town location next.,[]
located at the end of a magnificent block.,[]
what a ripoff!,[]
"but warning: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.",[]
"the space is a bit too small for live music, so on jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.",[]
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 8:30.,[]
"if you want to save some money, don't go here.",[]
but that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had.,[]
despite the untasteful previous review...,[]
"and, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.",[]
"and i have been around the block, to say the very least.",[]
we spent 50 $$ definetly will come back with my friends!!!,[]
oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.,[]
"yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.",[]
it was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.,[]
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.,[]
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaraunts.,[]
"obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong, it actually means great prosperity.",[]
"they treat me like family, morning and night.",[]
"check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.",[]
"oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.",[]
if you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here!,[]
stay far away from this place.,[]
i live on the street this place is on.,[]
a real dissapointment.,[]
"i am indian, and i have tried many indian places in ny.",[]
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.,[]
all i can say is wow!,[]
went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).,[]
"really though, where's the seasoning?",[]
went last thursday.,[]
"the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in chinese.",[]
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.,[]
i know because i live nearby.,[]
"the new york times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.",[]
they live up to the thai way of living.,[]
"wow! how have i missed this one ,tried long tan last week for the first time and now know what the ny times and many more in the neighborhood already knew.",[]
no free drink.,[]
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out.,[]
i loved it and will be back soon.,[]
i went with my fiance on a tuesday evening.,[]
i've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all.,[]
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.,[]
"may, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.",[]
i'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.,[]
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.,[]
don't be fooled by crowds of people.,[]
i went to ruby foo's after work with a group of 6.,[]
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i don't have to rush off to a show.,[]
"also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.",[]
"despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.",[]
"a big disappointment, all around.",[]
now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.,[]
"if you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!",[]
"oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!",[]
"this place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers, right off of pell st (barber's alley) in chinatown.",[]
"bravo, blue hill!",[]
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.,[]
they are fast.,[]
if you don't mind all that noise then go to the chart house.,[]
this one is definintely my least favorite.,[]
i loved the shows.,[]
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.,[]
my six year old loved it.,[]
i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde!,[]
"so close, but not good enough.",[]
we bring in a party of ten or so every week.,[]
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.,[]
i've been here twice now.,[]
enough said!,[]
i came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.,[]
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.,[]
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.,[]
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful.,[]
they charge different prices all the time.,[]
have the iced tea.,[]
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.,[]
i for one will never patronize them again.,[]
you should pass on the calamari.,[]
check it out,[]
"in fact, two people could really share one plate.",[]
we go often.,[]
i have never had cheescake like this.,[]
we were very disappointed.,[]
check it out.,[]
"i found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.",[]
during happy hour!,[]
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.,[]
"i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.",[]
i can't wait to go back.,[]
"hey, i think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.",[]
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde.,[]
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.,[]
"had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!",[]
"sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.",[]
"perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.",[]
you can't go wrong here.,[]
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly.,[]
i will be going back very soon.,[]
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects.,[]
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!,[]
we were less than impressed.,[]
and never strayed.,[]
"we asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.",[]
ummm...the beer was cold.,[]
go here.,[]
go here.,[]
romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).,[]
amazing!,[]
loved it!,[]
we were seated and ignored by waitstaff.,[]
i've never been disappointed.,[]
a defitely must visit.,[]
i in all reality felt as if i had just gotten off air france and was in the 8th district in paris.,[]
"try everything for that matter, it is all good.",[]
avoid at all costs.,[]
i don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.,[]
but trust me it is so worth it.,[]
"however, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.",[]
its not the same if you have to sit inside.,[]
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.,[]
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad.,[]
"filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.",[]
"for asian fusion, there are many places further downtown.",[]
unbelievable.,[]
unbelievable.,[]
big thumbs up!,[]
i hate hate hate this place.,[]
stick to the gulab jamun.,[]
"ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.",[]
"the large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.",[]
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.,[]
perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda.,[]
you will find yourself returning quite often.,[]
a hearty two thumbs up!,[]
"having discovered ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.",[]
this is also where i was from.,[]
"of course, it is crowded but who cares.",[]
"ambiance and music funky, which i enjoy.",[]
"but, they were too big for the bun.",[]
not what i wanted to hear.,[]
"from the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.",[]
"at 6:30, we were the third party there.",[]
don't go.,[]
"told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.",[]
"we could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.",[]
"oh right, i should probably say something nice.",[]
but i wouldn't wanna live there.,[]
finally!,[]
finally!,[]
"either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.",[]
sexy.,[]
"if just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.",[]
"then, get ripped on free box wine.",[]
i've never been treated so rudely.,[]
i love the atmorphere @ peep!,[]
always busy but fast moving.,[]
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.,[]
"go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby veal calf(ok bad joke), but you will see.",[]
my entire family was horrified.,[]
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?,[]
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.,[]
it could have been handled better.,[]
but too far east!,[]
i will not be coming here at 3am again.,[]
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.,[]
"we were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.",[]
"so, again, give it a try.",[]
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it,[]
never fails to please.,[]
kudos haru,[]
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.,[]
really.,[]
i won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.,[]
you guys are awesome!,[]
nice find.,[]
"the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you, brother?",[]
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.,[]
we weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.,[]
you have to increase the service a lot.,[]
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.,[]
we will go back every time we are in the city.,[]
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!,[]
but $1 for each small piece???,[]
i don't think i would go again.,[]
big and gawky on the outside.,[]
"needless to say, i'm never going back and you should be wary too.",[]
no plans to return anytime soon.,[]
its located in greenewich village.,[]
my friends and i showed up on a sat.,[]
i was glad i did.,[]
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling.,[]
i pray it stays open forever.,[]
it just wasn't thai.,[]
"i need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!",[]
there are other people waiting!,[]
and it was quick which is very important.,[]
"when i called this morning, i didn't think i would be able to get in at 12, but i was able to get in, along with four other guests.",[]
you guys rock.,[]
really depends on your luck!,[]
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (anywhere).,[]
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu.,[]
"same owner as the guy who owns typhoon, which is just down the street on st. marks and 1st ave.",[]
"after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.",[]
several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.,[]
plenty of choices to make your own creation.,[]
first of all dal bukhara rocks.,[]
"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.",[]
"it's true, you feel like your in a scene from goodfellas.",[]
but overall i give it a 10,[]
everyone treats you like you were part of the family.,[]
i was there on sat.,[]
i just read mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.,[]
not worth it.,[]
this was on a tuesday night.,[]
i definitely will go back.,[]
i definitely wouldn't go back.,[]
they don't walk around with the trays of dim sum.,[]
"when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.",[]
"we left, never to return.",[]
"so, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, i would say try it.",[]
"whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.",[]
"yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.",[]
we were then shooed inside.,[]
too large for just two people but nothing was left.,[]
"still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...",[]
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores.,[]
it is not worth for that bucks.,[]
and all of that won't break your bank!,[]
is just the way it was in days gone by.,[]
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend.,[]
"i am so coming back here again, as much as i can.",[]
"we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.",[]
less wait time for me!,[]
i hate this.,[]
i plan on stopping by next week as well.,[]
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.,[]
i must give it yon out of yon stars!,[]
"read all the other review, they'll confirm it.",[]
"he can't help, they're bought up so fast.",[]
we were a group of 8 and well seved.,[]
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.,[]
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular.,[]
so i thought why not change it up a bit.,[]
i have been going back again and again.,[]
bon appettite!!,[]
unique apppetizers.,[]
i am french and i really felt like home!!!,[]
so rude.,[]
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.,[]
i'll keep this short.,[]
i have never been disappointed in the red eye.,[]
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!,[]
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.,[]
we've lived in the area for more than 8 years.,[]
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited.,[]
everyone was more then happy with his choices.,[]
go inside and you won't want to leave.,[]
would definitely go back again.,[]
go for it!,[]
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.,[]
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.,[]
and we were thouroughly disapointed.,[]
"if you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what rao's is all about.",[]

"all in all, i don't see how you can go wrong.",[]
i cannot recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself.,[]
you are treated just like royality.,[]
but still my date was bad,[]
i thought i had died and gone to heaven.,[]
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.,[]
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.,[]
and i could do without the cigar smoke.,[]
"no refills on fountain drinks, though.",[]
hmmm.,[]
get it together.,[]
i am a die hard peep lover.,[]
but that is highly forgivable.,[]
"the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).",[]

it's to die for!,[]
they never came back to refill our glasses again.,[]

"to speak of the park side, words can not describe.",[]
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.,[]

will give it another chance before i write it off.,[]
great deal!,[]
it appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.,[]
"then, if they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!",[]
i will be returning.,[]
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 10:15.,[]
molto bene!,[]
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.,[]
i'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much.,[]
i've been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.,[]
this is the first time citysearch did't call it right.,[]

i would just ask for no oil next time.,[]
"aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, will smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....",[]

"i will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!",[]
