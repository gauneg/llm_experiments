you'll adore it.,[]
two words: free wine.,[]
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.,[]
"whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.",[]
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends!,[]
not what i wanted to hear.,[]
can't wait to go back.,[]
deff recimmend bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.,[]
"my husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.",[]
"this place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps queens' biggest secret!",[]
i was glad i did.,[]
i've never been treated so rudely.,[]
i'll be back soon.,[]
went inside and i started to get excited.,[]
"however, it is jus too good to not praise it.",[]
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.,[]

"had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!",[]
but overall i give it a 10,[]
i was there on sat.,[]
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it,[]
what more can you ask for?,[]
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.,[]
you are treated just like royality.,[]
"there's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).",[]
ambiance- relaxed and stylish.,[]
"looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).",[]
i know because i live nearby.,[]
my entire family was horrified.,[]
on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out.,[]
hats off to the chef.,[]
this should have been done in a back room - away from customers.,[]
check it out,[]
don't go.,[]
but they do.,[]
"ambiance and music funky, which i enjoy.",[]
"it's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.",[]
went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).,[]
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend.,[]
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.,[]
enjoy!,[]
we weren't!,[]
please be aware that it's cash or amex only!,[]
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.,[]
"so i've never actually been to m proper, but i've had it delivered a few times.",[]
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.,[]
"a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.",[]
"(or sister, in my case!).",[]
don't go there!,[]
"ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.",[]
good luck getting a table.,[]
don't look down your nose at me like that...,[]
just don't do it.,[]
"trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.",[]
finally!,[]
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes.,[]
you will not be disapointed at all.,[]
open late (well as late as i ever got there and i'm a night person),[]
"the most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.",[]
"get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.",[]
something about them being busy with holiday party's.,[]
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.,[]
we visit at least once a month.,[]
"also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.",[]
i'll keep this short.,[]
and it was quick which is very important.,[]
always busy but fast moving.,[]
i'm not picky - but it was actually gross.,[]
"since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.",[]
despite the untasteful previous review...,[]
"don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.",[]
"sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know sal, is to know new york.",[]
also they were $15 each!,[]
we will go back every time we are in the city.,[]
we love th pink pony.,[]
i have to agree with the previous reviewer.,[]
it's convenient.,[]
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip.,[]
"oh right, i should probably say something nice.",[]
"the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).",[]
perhaps.,[]
go here.,[]
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave.,[]
"my wife and i always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.",[]
"by the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.",[]
"read all the other review, they'll confirm it.",[]
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there.,[]
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.,[]
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.,[]
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.,[]
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.,[]
"we could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.",[]
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.,[]
what a ripoff!,[]
you can do it here.,[]
"may, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.",[]
i've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all.,[]
i just read mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.,[]
it hits the spot every time,[]
don't be fooled by crowds of people.,[]
and there's no way out.,[]
"please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.",[]
"for all you lazy folks that don't want to come to alphabet city, i say, good - stay out.",[]
"this is my fourth try over a two year period, and i'm done.",[]
probably would not go again...,[]
it was horrible.,[]
"the new york times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.",[]
"really though, where's the seasoning?",[]
it is thick and slightly soggy.,[]
its not the same if you have to sit inside.,[]
great people watching as others do the same to you.,[]
i'm going back.,[]
me and my girls will definitely go back.,[]
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.,[]
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.,[]
have been several times and it never dissapoints.,[]
while i'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!,[]
"first of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by citysearch's editorial review.",[]
why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?,[]
highly recommended!!!!!,[]
"for $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.",[]
"as we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.",[]
"in fact, two people could really share one plate.",[]
this was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.,[]
during happy hour!,[]
"go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it.",[]
i am bringing my whole family back next time.,[]
overall i would recommend it and go back again.,[]
"anyway, this is the last time i cross the williamsburg.",[]
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.,[]
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!,[]
"oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.",[]
definately check it out!!!,[]
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.,[]
"saturday, nov. 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us.",[]
we will be back.,[]
check out the secret back room.,[]
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.,[]
i got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!,[]
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?,[]
go inside and you won't want to leave.,[]
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get.,[]
"the large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.",[]
i would go back tho.,[]
too large for just two people but nothing was left.,[]
a pleasant surprise.,[]
we got most of it back at home with us.,[]
"if this happens, just ask for real naan.",[]
"so, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, i would say try it.",[]
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.,[]
there are other people waiting!,[]
"we left, never to return.",[]
this is where the aforementioned line was.,[]
"aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, will smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....",[]
i dont how this place is still running.,[]
what more could you want?,[]
"all in all, i don't see how you can go wrong.",[]
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.,[]
i'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.,[]
"still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...",[]
"even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.",[]
was surprisingly disappointed.,[]
i'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.,[]
"behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.",[]
"if only they delivered, they'd make a mint!",[]
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.,[]
"in any event, this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town.",[]
i definitely wouldn't go back.,[]
it is not worth for that bucks.,[]
a hearty two thumbs up!,[]
all pretty good.,[]
"you can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.",[]
you guys rock.,[]
tends to turn people away.,[]
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.,[]
"if you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!",[]
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!,[]
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects.,[]
"no refills on fountain drinks, though.",[]
did i mention the wine?,[]
now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.,[]
less = more in their case.,[]
"however, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.",[]
"i found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.",[]
located at the end of a magnificent block.,[]
they don't walk around with the trays of dim sum.,[]
took my sister here before attending a show one evening.,[]
really.,[]
our friends have not arrived yet.,[]
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.,[]
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,[]
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square.,[]
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!,[]
"when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",[]
no thanks!!!,[]
"there was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.",[]
"a big disappointment, all around.",[]
no free drink.,[]
definitely highly not recommended.,[]
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.,[]
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.,[]
i pray it stays open forever.,[]
"if you want to save some money, don't go here.",[]
this is the first time citysearch did't call it right.,[]
what for?,[]
fantastic!,[]
skip this location and go to the one in soho.,[]
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there.,[]
"i need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!",[]
molto bene!,[]
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.,[]
went here on a friend's reccomendation.,[]
we will definitely go back.,[]
is just the way it was in days gone by.,[]
"it can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.",[]
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful.,[]
just go and see for yourself.,[]
i hate this.,[]
get over it!,[]
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.,[]
"while it's not nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.",[]
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.,[]
i don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.,[]
they are located in the middle of chinatown!,[]
check it out.,[]
i would go again if i didn't have to pay.,[]
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i don't have to rush off to a show.,[]
go here.,[]
we weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.,[]
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it .,[]
over 100 different choices to create your own.,[]
i loved it and will be back soon.,[]
"always a nice crowd, but never loud.",[]
"told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.",[]
just awsome.,[]
"i will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!",[]
this is one of our all-time favorite.,[]
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.,[]
it's a steal!,[]
what's the difference between the two?,[]
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!,[]
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment.,[]
will never be back.,[]
oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.,[]
my six year old loved it.,[]
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.,[]
"worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.",[]
"inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.",[]
i'm sure i'll return for a final judgement tho.,[]
"of course, it is crowded but who cares.",[]
hmmm.,[]
"overall, worht every penny.",[]
"when i called this morning, i didn't think i would be able to get in at 12, but i was able to get in, along with four other guests.",[]
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build.,[]
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.,[]
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.,[]
"the place does get crowded, so i recommend going between 4-5 pm.",[]
but i'd go back,[]
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting.,[]
i don't think i would go again.,[]
we were a group of 8 and well seved.,[]
and that's no mean feat...,[]
i wish they would change back to what it was before.,[]
i noted it was crossed off on the bill.,[]
"needless to say, i'm never going back and you should be wary too.",[]
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.,[]
first it took us a long time to find the place.,[]
"immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.",[]
"once you become a regular, you are treated as one.",[]
everyone treats you like you were part of the family.,[]
the menu is nothing like the one on the website.,[]
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly.,[]
not worth it.,[]
"in the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, ny crowd.",[]
"so close, but not good enough.",[]
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (i happen to live in inwood).,[]
"don't waste your time, or money!!",[]
"they don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.",[]
this was a great surprise.,[]
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.,[]
i don't get it either.,[]
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.,[]
"they brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.",[]
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.,[]
i for one will never patronize them again.,[]
"so, again, give it a try.",[]
stay far away from this place.,[]
we will come back!!!,[]
we'd go back again,[]
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience.,[]
i only have friends.,[]
please save yourself the frustration.,[]
every course was better than the next.,[]
"not cheap, but not that expensive either.",[]
everyone is welcomed in as family.,[]
"hey, i think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.",[]
look elsewhere.,[]
a real dissapointment.,[]
why do people rave about the ambience.,[]
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.,[]
would definitely visit again.,[]
so i thought why not change it up a bit.,[]
just an odd group.,[]
"either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.",[]
it is not consistent.,[]
"drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.",[]
"and the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!",[]
good drink.,[]
was there friday night.,[]
romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).,[]
"however, i was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from london noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.",[]
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well.,[]
enough said!,[]
i don't live in ny but my best friend does.,[]
"we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.",[]
"yeah, it's that good.",[]
they charge different prices all the time.,[]
"i am so coming back here again, as much as i can.",[]
i have been going back again and again.,[]
"to begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.",[]
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly i might add).,[]
"don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.",[]
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.,[]
but too far east!,[]
satisfying.,[]
highly highly highly recommended!,[]
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.,[]
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv.,[]
you will find yourself returning quite often.,[]
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.,[]
it appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.,[]
i go twice a month!,[]
"if celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.",[]
i love it.,[]
"we had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.",[]
its located in greenewich village.,[]
we bring in a party of ten or so every week.,[]
we would return to this place again!,[]
"we were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.",[]
"to me it exemplifies soho, cute, artsy, interesting.",[]
"try everything for that matter, it is all good.",[]
i agree.,[]
"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.",[]
recommended.,[]
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.,[]
go girls!!!,[]
old school meets new world.,[]
"for being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.",[]
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.,[]
they all know you.,[]
i've been several times and am totally smitten.,[]
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited.,[]
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors.,[]
this one is definintely my least favorite.,[]
we were not disappointed.,[]
"when we left at 8:00 pm, it was packed and noisy.",[]
"okay, so i never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and it's time to speak up - i live in chinatown.",[]
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.,[]
never fails to please.,[]
will absolutely visit again.,[]
we spent 50 $$ definetly will come back with my friends!!!,[]
"some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.",[]
that's good and bad.,[]
would never go back there.,[]
"be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!",[]
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (anywhere).,[]
i've been here twice now.,[]
i will be returning.,[]
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!,[]
"shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.",[]
try it side by side and there's no comparison.,[]
lloovve this place.,[]
went last thursday.,[]
"we only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.",[]
"he always says, i don't have customers.",[]
we had a good time.,[]
"also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...",[]
people are rude bit again it's new york!,[]
i live on the street this place is on.,[]
horrible.,[]
here's to the fake fish tanks too...,[]
and never strayed.,[]
leave the kids at home!,[]
and all of that won't break your bank!,[]
big thumbs up!,[]
they even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.,[]
it's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.,[]
that's why you have to pay more for that.,[]
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.,[]
i loved it.,[]
but i wouldn't wanna live there.,[]
arigato gozimas yuka!,[]
"yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.",[]
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.,[]
i loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.,[]
zero ambiance to boot.,[]
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.,[]
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.,[]
"it is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's nyc!",[]
"we asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.",[]
"however, their popularity has yet to slow down, and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.",[]
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.,[]
i loved the shows.,[]
"and i have been around the block, to say the very least.",[]
"then, get ripped on free box wine.",[]
"also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.",[]
...and that's saying a lot.,[]
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.,[]
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.,[]
"obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong, it actually means great prosperity.",[]
"when you want a piece of beef, head on over.",[]
"also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!",[]
unbelievable.,[]
"my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.",[]
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you.,[]
i thought i had died and gone to heaven.,[]
"not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again, i will certainly stop by.",[]
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.,[]
"always popular, always full, always a wait.",[]
"in fact, you can't miss it.",[]
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.,[]
"again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.",[]
get it together.,[]
"the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in chinese.",[]
enjoy!!!,[]
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday.,[]
"if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.",[]
never again!,[]
have the iced tea.,[]
for park avenue i expected so much more.,[]
so rude.,[]
they are fast.,[]
and i could do without the cigar smoke.,[]
great deal!,[]
stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).,[]
i plan on stopping by next week as well.,[]
"compared to ess-a, tal offers a less doughy bagel!",[]
"then, if they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!",[]
highly recommended to all!,[]
highly recommended.,[]
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.,[]
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc.,[]
"when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.",[]
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.,[]
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.,[]
bravissimo !!,[]
"when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.",[]
it's to die for!,[]
you will be satisfied.,[]
we were less than impressed.,[]
but still my date was bad,[]
would definitely go back again.,[]
go for it!,[]
highly recommended.,[]
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.,[]
"to speak of the park side, words can not describe.",[]
but $1 for each small piece???,[]
i was wrong.,[]
no plans to return anytime soon.,[]
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about.,[]
"but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the bts.",[]
and you're hungry a few hours later.,[]
i can't wait to go back.,[]
i hate hate hate this place.,[]
wonderful!,[]
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.,[]
all i can say is wow!,[]
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.,[]
"sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.",[]
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!,[]
wont come back again for sure!,[]
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.,[]
"after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.",[]
bon appettite!!,[]
"bravo, blue hill!",[]
"conveniently located too, being right on bedford ave.",[]
"we, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.",[]
"at 6:30, we were the third party there.",[]
i will definetly be going back.,[]
"no, really.",[]
i'm saving up for my next visit.,[]
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.,[]
"been there, done that, and new york, it's not that big a deal.",[]
from an english speaking staff.,[]
a defitely must visit.,[]
my friends and i showed up on a sat.,[]
"if the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.",[]
"however, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.",[]
"the main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.",[]
"just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.",[]
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular.,[]
i definitely will go back.,[]
finally!,[]
i've never been disappointed.,[]
i won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.,[]
"from the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.",[]
"i wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.",[]
"for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, i don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.",[]
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out.,[]
"oh yes, and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, i would love to know where they obtained.",[]
this is also where i was from.,[]
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.,[]
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.,[]
i have never had anything like it!,[]
"yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.",[]
"they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.",[]
"i am indian, and i have tried many indian places in ny.",[]
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl.,[]
it was divine melts in your mouth.,[]
i came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.,[]
and we were thouroughly disapointed.,[]
"our teenage kids love it, too.",[]
you guys are awesome!,[]
avoid at all costs.,[]
i recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon,[]
i would just ask for no oil next time.,[]
"they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!",[]
"perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.",[]
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.,[]
"their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for purple haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!",[]
"my husband and i both ordered the steak, medium.",[]
owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.,[]
i would go back.,[]
definitely will be back!,[]
i'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much.,[]
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected.,[]
this is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.,[]
"overall, not worth the money.",[]
we left after one drink.,[]
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.,[]
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.,[]
"it was raining, and we figured why not?",[]
another welcome addition to the neighborhood.,[]
"this time, i prefer not to go into detail.",[]
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!,[]
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.,[]
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores.,[]
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.,[]
it was a very nice surprise.,[]
i am french and i really felt like home!!!,[]
i cannot recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself.,[]
"and, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.",[]
there was no ambiance.,[]
but trust me it is so worth it.,[]
"the only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4, which makes no sense whatsoever.",[]
they never came back to refill our glasses again.,[]
"they're rude at times, and not very friendly.",[]
"good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on fridays.",[]
i loved it and would go again.,[]
so so so so so good!,[]
we go often.,[]
moral stay away.,[]
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.,[]
they're terrific!!,[]
"this place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers, right off of pell st (barber's alley) in chinatown.",[]
just wish they'd expand.,[]
i will go back to suan soon!,[]
loved it!,[]
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.,[]
will give it another chance before i write it off.,[]
the all-italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.,[]
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.,[]
stay away from this place.,[]
"the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you, brother?",[]
brava la pizza fresca!,[]
"check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.",[]
"if just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.",[]
i go back in line like three times on average until i can't walk anymore.,[]
i will not be coming here at 3am again.,[]
unbelievable.,[]
we will be back.,[]
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.,[]
and everytime i go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.,[]
"when we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.",[]
amazing!,[]
i've always been seated propmtly.,[]
there is nothing more pleasant than that.,[]
"they treat me like family, morning and night.",[]
i went to amma after a friend recommended it.,[]
i'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.,[]
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.,[]
maybe tomorrow ;-),[]
please don't fool us.,[]
"strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.",[]
we were then shooed inside.,[]
"it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.",[]
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.,[]
"a gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.",[]
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaraunts.,[]
"when you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.",[]
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too.,[]
"in fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.",[]
for meetball night.,[]
want to impress?,[]
we've lived in the area for more than 8 years.,[]
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.,[]
a one women show!,[]
you can't go wrong here.,[]
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues.,[]
"to my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.",[]
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 10:15.,[]
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies.,[]
boy was i wrong!,[]
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke.,[]
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.,[]
ahhh...,[]
but that is highly forgivable.,[]
i am going to the mid town location next.,[]
